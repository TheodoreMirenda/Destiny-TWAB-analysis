One of those old-fashioned rocks that don't have internet access. If you haven\u2019t seen the trailer or any news about our upcoming Season, this is your final ***SPOILER WARNING***.\u00a0\n\n\nAlright, still here? Cool. That means you\u2019ve thrown caution to the wind and want to know more about the new Season before it\u2019s out. Before we go on, watch the trailer. Doesn\u2019t matter if you already have. Watch it again. We all need a little more neon in our lives.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/crKGHG3stbY)\n\n\nVex? Endless night? Mithrax? Baby Eliksni? Yeah. This is going to be a wild Season. Things will kick off with a bang, followed by activities, rewards, and more. We shared the Vault of Glass launch date last week, and now you can see everything from Iron Banner to the new 6-player offensive: Override.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150771/s14_calendar_en.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yUouiRT.jpg)\n\n\nWant a handful of stunning visuals to go along with your details? Don\u2019t miss out on the new Bungie.net [Season of the Splicer page](https://www.bungie.net/SeasonOfTheSplicer).\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Rewards Preview\u00a0\n\nLoot is the name of the game for many a Guardian, so let\u2019s get down to business. We\u2019ll be working with the Fallen this Season, and we\u2019ve got new armor pieces to earn. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to embrace the Splicer lifestyle, this Season will be your chance.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150771/JJ_FreeArmor_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/k4HWMvJ.jpg)\n\n\nPreviously, you would earn this armor by leveling your Season Rank and unlocking new pieces on the Seasonal Track. Moving forward, Seasonal Armor will be earned from Seasonal activities. You'll also be able to guarantee pieces from these sets using Focused Umbral Engrams. Season Rank levels that once featured armor have been updated with packages of Glimmer, Legendary Shards, Upgrade Modules, Exotic Engrams, Enhancement Cores, and Enhancement Prisms. Universal Armor Ornaments will continue to be earned towards the end of the Season Pass.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150771/JJ_UniversalArmor_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nyX98AQ.jpg)\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk tools of destruction. There\u2019s still gold to find in them Seasonal Rank hills. On the Seasonal Track, there will be three weapons to earn. Season Pass owners will unlock the new Exotic Sidearm on day-one of the Season as soon as they claim their first reward. Additionally, the new Shotgun and Heavy Machine Gun will be up for grabs as you level up.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150771/JJ_S14_SeasonPassWeapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/QaoxRhB.jpg)\n\n\nIf you want a full loadout of this style, we\u2019ve got you covered. New weapons will be available through Umbral Engrams and Override completions.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150771/s14_armaments_carousel_2.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/EkSY6bW.jpg)\n\n\nOutside of Override, there's even more Legendary loot to claim. To start, you'll receive a new quest to earn the Null Composure Fusion Rifle. Once the weapon is unlocked, you can collect Gambit, Crucible, and Vanguard themed weapon ornaments to further customize your style.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150771/JJ_S14_RitualFusionRifle.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/gTbQl3j.jpg)\n\n\nThere are also weapons joining the current slate of post-game rewards for Gambit, Crucible, and Vanguard Strikes. In total, there will be 12 Legendary weapons to earn -- four per activity.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150771/JJ_S14_RitualLegendaryWeapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aLTeaXu.jpg)\n\n\nFor the endgame focused Guardians out there, three familiar weapons will be up for grabs. We have no doubt the Destiny 1 veterans among you will recall these legends in an instant.\u00a0\n\n\nLike last Season, each weapon will be on a weekly rotation in Nightfall playlists. Upping the difficulty will give you a higher drop chance as you search for desired rolls. Starting June 22, Grandmaster Nightfalls will become available, introducing Adept versions of each weapon.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150771/JJ_S14_VanguardWeapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jBg0lcK.jpg)\n\n\nNow, here\u2019s the part where we say, \u201cand more.\u201d There are still more weapons left for you to discover as you play.\u00a0\n\n\nSome of the best feelings in Destiny are those moments where you uncover a sweet weapon with the perfect perk combination. Want an Auto Rifle that gains extra damage after defeating an enemy with a grenade? How about a Sniper that\u2019s quick on the draw, but can also be rolled with Dragonfly? Every Season invites interesting choices and new playstyles.\u00a0\n\n\nI\u2019m personally amped for a new Pulse Rifle from the Seasonal offering that\u2019ll fire quick with just a little kick, so to speak. The team has cooked up some fun new perks this season too, so you'll have some opportunity to mix some flavors you know with fresh ingredients. We haven\u2019t even covered Artifact mods yet, which can turn some of these weapons up to 11.\u00a0\n\n\nFive days, and the hunt for loot begins anew. See you soon.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patchwork\u00a0\n\n\nEach Season brings opportunities to address longstanding feedback items, or even make some backend changes to prepare for bright futures. Destiny 2 Update 3.2.0 has quite a few bullets in the changelist, but we\u2019d like to highlight a few things that we\u2019re pretty excited for! Let\u2019s dive in:\u00a0\n\n\n**Abilities, Aspects, and Fragments\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Colorblind Support\u00a0\n\n\n   * Stasis abilities now have colorblind support:\u00a0\n\n\n      * Enemy Crystals\u00a0\n      * Enemy Squall\u00a0\n      * Enemy Duskfield\u00a0\n      * Enemy Bleak Watcher\u00a0\n   * Player highlighting in the Crucible now has colorblind support.\u00a0\n* Sublcass Tuning\u00a0\n\n\n   * Hunters\u00a0\n\n\n      * The freeze detonation from Silence &amp; Squall has been reduced from 12m to 8.5m in radius.\u00a0\n      * Enemy Squall now has a red ring to define area as it approaches.\u00a0\n   * Titans\u00a0\n\n\n      * Shiver Strike melee energy is now refunded when Glacial Quake ends.\u00a0\u00a0\n      * Fixed an issue in which players can trigger Whisper of Torment by standing in an opponent's Barricade.\u00a0\n   * Warlocks\u00a0\n\n\n      * Shadebinder\u00a0\n\n\n         * Bleak Watcher Aspect now grants two fragment slots.\u00a0\n      * Chaos Reach\u00a0\n\n\n         * Fixed an issue with Chaos Reach Super that was allowing it to penetrate some thin walls or objects enough to damage and kill opponents on the other side.\u00a0\n\n\nRegarding future tuning plans, we also wanted to pull a word from **Sandbox Discipline Lead Kevin Yanes**:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Kevin:** Hey all!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Sandbox team is working on a slew of tuning updates over the next few Seasons. We're aware of key points of feedback in PvE and PvP. In update 3.2.0, we have a few minor changes to Stasis Hunters and some bug fixes that you see above. Here\u2019s a quick list of some key places we're actively looking at for the future: Stasis Freeze, Slow accuracy penalties, and Whisper of Hedrons. We will share more with you soon.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, back to the patch notes preview!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Nav Mode\u00a0(Menu that appears when pulling out your Ghost)**\n\n\n\n* Separated Bounties from Quests in Nav Mode.\u00a0\n* All Bounties now appear in Nav Mode. They can no longer be tracked as a result.\u00a0\n* Category switching on keyboard and mouse can now be controlled with the scroll wheel.\u00a0\n* Tracked Triumph now appears in its own Nav Mode category.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link]( /pubassets/pkgs/150/150773/TWAB_Request_v3_ESRB_16x9_1080p30_H264.mp4)\n\n\n**UI**\n\n\n\n* Legends added to the Director Destinations tab.\u00a0\n\n\n   * This is where you\u2019ll find Vault of Glass in just a few weeks...\u00a0\n* Shortcut between HUD quest step notifications and quest details screen added for keyboard and mouse users.\u00a0\n* 6v6 Crucible activities have an updated intro experience.\u00a0\n\n\n   * Cycle through your teammates to view metrics associated with the activity you're entering.\u00a0\n\n\n**H.E.L.M.\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* H.E.L.M. now appears in the Director Destinations tab (moved from Tower map) and has its own map.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Focused Umbral Engrams and Prismatic Recaster\u00a0\n\n\n   * Umbral Engrams now auto-decrypt when Focused via the Prismatic Recaster.\u00a0\n   * The visual states for focusing options on the Prismatic Recaster have been streamlined to reduce visual clutter and confusion.\u00a0\n\n\n**Glory, Valor, and Infamy\u00a0**\n\n\nThese changes are a precursor to some larger improvements planned for Season 15 (e.g., introducing Vanguard reputation, rebalancing Infamy to bring a reset in-line with Valor, and more). We\u2019ll have more information on those changes in a few months!\u00a0\n\n\n* Glory, Valor, and Infamy reputations have had their internal systems rebuilt to a unified implementation. In-game, players should expect minimal perceived changes.\u00a0\n\n\n   * Unified Glory, Valor, and Infamy rank reputation tracking.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n      * Before Forsaken, Glory and Valor had only Major ranks (Guardian, Brave, etc.).\u00a0\n      * After Forsaken, Glory and Valor gained sub-ranks (Brave I, II, III) alongside Infamy. However, all the historical tracking (Lifetime Ranks) and quest usage still used the original Major ranks.\u00a0\n      * Now, the sub-ranks are now referred to simply as Ranks, and all usage has been converted to use them where appropriate. (I.e., all lifetime values and quest targets have been multiplied by three.)\u00a0\n   * Glory playlists no longer block Valor win streaks from declining.\u00a0\n   * The Valor badge now appears on the Trials launch screen.\u00a0\n   * Infamy win streak bonus is now linear (+35 points per win).\u00a0\n   * Glory win streak bonus is now linear (+20 points per win).\u00a0\n\n\n      * Note: With the eventual update to Vanguard reputation, players should be ready to spend their Vanguard Tokens during Season of the Splicer.\u00a0\n\n\n**Eververse\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Eververse Archive Filtering\u00a0\n\n\n   * Players can now easily filter the offerings in the Storefront Archive tab.\u00a0\n   * Per numerous community requests, we added many Exotic weapon and armor ornaments from previous Seasons to the archive tab.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Bright Engrams\u00a0\n\n\n   * Spawn FX and Shaders are now standalone items in Bright Engrams.\u00a0\n\n\n      * Bright Engrams can no longer decrypt into duplicates of these items.\u00a0\n   * A small amount of Glimmer will be awarded when decrypting Bright Engrams.\u00a0\n\n\n**General Things...\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Momentum Control and Team Scorched have returned and will be available as part of the weekly playlist rotation.\u00a0\n* Added repeatable bounties to Shaw Han in the Cosmodrome.\u00a0\n* Fixed an issue causing Vaulted gear to erroneously drop from strike-unique loot lists.\u00a0\n* Added a full suite of Trace Rifle-focused armor mods to the game.\u00a0\n\n\nPatch notes are planned to drop, in full, around 10 AM PDT next Tuesday, right alongside the release of Season of the Splicer.\u00a0\n\n\nAh, and one more thing before we go. While the following won\u2019t happen in Update 3.2.0, we have some news concerning 2018 and 2019 Solstice of Heroes Armor Glows. In the [April 22 TWAB article](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50272), it was stated that glows for these armor sets would not be supported by Armor Synthesis due to technical issues. Since the new 2020 ornament mechanics were well received, we were able to rework/rebuild how 2018 and 2019 glows worked to address the community's request.\u00a0\n\n\nOur current plan is to make these glows into universal ornament sets like 2020 Solstice of Heroes Universal Armor Ornaments. This fix will have some limitations. These ornaments will not be updated to support Stasis, but will support Solar, Arc, or Void subclasses. In addition, the granted ornaments will be for the legendary armor set from each year only. Players who acquired any subclass type glow for that year/slot will receive the corresponding Legendary Universal Ornament for all three classes.\u00a0\n\n\nWe are hoping to have this fix deployed by Solstice of Heroes 2021, but we cannot yet guarantee the date. Stay tuned to future TWAB\u2019s for additional information.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Prepare for Download\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6SCjHHf.gif)\n\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cfinal countdown\u201d in a live-service environment. We\u2019ve preformed this ritual many times before, but it\u2019s just as exciting today as it was back in 2014. Player Support knows the song, and it\u2019s almost time to dance.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n**SEASONAL TITLES AND BUNGIE REWARDS\u00a0\u00a0**\n\n\nSeason of the Chosen ends on May 11. View our Update 3.2.0 timeline below for what time it will end, and Season of the Splicer begins.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBefore the Season ends, players who earned the **Chosen**, **Conqueror**, and **Flawless** titles should claim and equip them to ensure that they don\u2019t get removed.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nMultiple Bungie Rewards should also be earned in-game before **May 11 at 10 AM PDT**, and claimed on the [Bungie Rewards site](https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/Rewards) by **May 14, 2021, at 9:59 AM PDT**:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Europa Penguin Figurine\u00a0\n* Chosen Seal Pin (players should equip the title to ensure that it\u2019s earned)\u00a0\u00a0\n* Hawkmoon Long-Sleeve Shirt\u00a0\n* Guardian Games Gold Medal Pin\u00a0\n* Guardian Games 2021 Jacket\u00a0\n\n\n**SEASONAL CHALLENGES\u00a0**\n\n\nAs we announced earlier, when Season of the Chosen ends and Season of the Splicer begins, Seasonal Challenges from Season of the Chosen will be retired. Any Seasonal Challenges that are required to upgrade the War Table in the H.E.L.M. will still be available to complete.\u00a0\n\n\n**SHADER UPKEEP\u00a0**\n\n\nBeginning in Season of the Splicer, we are overhauling our shader system and how shaders can be applied to armor. Due to the overhaul, shaders will become permanent unlocks, and all shaders in player inventories will be removed. We encourage everyone to dismantle their shaders before Season of the Splicer begins to receive Glimmer and Legendary Shards.\u00a0\n\n\n**UPDATE 3.2.0 AND MAINTENANCE TIMELINE\u00a0\u00a0**\n\n\nFriday, May 7, Destiny 2 will undergo maintenance in preparation for Destiny 2 Update 3.2.0.

If you\u2019d like your work to be featured, don\u2019t forget to include a #Destiny, #Destiny2, or even #SeasonoftheSplicer tag with your posts.\u00a0\n\n\nWe scroll through a lot of hashtags. Too many, some might say. We disagree.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThat's it! You've arrived at the end of the TWAB. A few thousand words of fun, but every show must come to an end.\n\n\n\nThis week was a wonderful opportunity to show off some shiny new toys, but the real fun will kick off next Tuesday. The team will be watching as players embark on a new journey of discovery. While I said that earning new loot can be one of the best feelings in Destiny, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more satisfying for us on the development side than seeing content finally get into your hands. New story, new lore, new loot, and hopefully some new friendships to make along the way.\u00a0\n\n\nThanks for stopping by. See you again soon. This time next week, I'll be wearing some fancy new clothes as I start to prep for Vault of Glass...\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\u65e9\u304f\u4e0a\u7d1a\u8005\u30bb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u307b\u3057\u3044 [pic.twitter.com/WNrgnxWwnr](https://t.co/WNrgnxWwnr)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 \u3055\u306e\u26f0\ufe0f (@6zspf) [May 4, 2021](https://twitter.com/6zspf/status/1389653305610047488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 2054620, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 5/06/2021", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/n6hqhc/this_week_at_bungie_5062021/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1619730694, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/n1ecrh/this_week_at_bungie_4292021/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n1ecrh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_css_class": "bungie", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Bungie"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2f13ba30-3d46-11e9-8cd7-0e03d8e4b5da", "link_flair_text": "Bungie", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1741, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/n1ecrh/this_week_at_bungie_4292021/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "X84pmDm6qM3tvIvueI4yidJ1wxAtp5CavQOCZTmPbYo", "resolutions": [{"height": 34, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FIxcPR4QeXIsetYk69fBNTQ2BG6JOivEHXMhaykPvIQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29d3d4bf0918999348bd68f4e50190c418c04555", "width": 108}, {"height": 68, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FIxcPR4QeXIsetYk69fBNTQ2BG6JOivEHXMhaykPvIQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=711da908d175c60a21f17452b149ca9c05f4ca64", "width": 216}, {"height": 100, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FIxcPR4QeXIsetYk69fBNTQ2BG6JOivEHXMhaykPvIQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=459fc16dc84ff3287a687c4dd6800ebe69bbc9f6", "width": 320}, {"height": 201, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FIxcPR4QeXIsetYk69fBNTQ2BG6JOivEHXMhaykPvIQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31d62880fc0c9a83388d6ca534c1ae9380aa99a1", "width": 640}, {"height": 302, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FIxcPR4QeXIsetYk69fBNTQ2BG6JOivEHXMhaykPvIQ.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd489ac7393d7a4f7fa1b1980e09b77733d07e91", "width": 960}, {"height": 340, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FIxcPR4QeXIsetYk69fBNTQ2BG6JOivEHXMhaykPvIQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5ff1905a488bc154aae336f3c4c766adfdaa7f9", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/FIxcPR4QeXIsetYk69fBNTQ2BG6JOivEHXMhaykPvIQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f96d9acec81e7554c8cb2ca08e6d9c1266367545", "width": 1270}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1619730705, "score": 1, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50287\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we set the starting line.\u00a0\n\n\nSeason of the Chosen is starting to wind down and we are preparing to transition into Season of [Redacted]. While things are winding down, many of you are still on the path to finishing your Seasonal Challenges. While some activities have come and gone, there\u2019s still ample time for you to complete Challenges that require longer time commitments. Nightfalls have double rewards this week for those on the hunt for sweet Legendary rolls. Next week, double Infamy will help many of you finish up the \u201cIn it for Infamy\u201d Challenge.

Let\u2019s get into it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Ready, Set, Raid!\u00a0\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t already heard, Vault of Glass is coming to Destiny 2 for the first time next Season. And though we haven\u2019t revealed Season of [Redacted] yet, we want to make sure you have time to make any arrangements necessary if you are planning on taking on the challenge of getting a VoG raid clear on day one.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n###**Vault of Glass will go live on May 22 at 10 AM PDT**\n\nThat\u2019s right, Guardians will be going up against Atheon in less than a month. The story isn\u2019t changing, but you may notice other differences. Our goal was to keep the feeling similar to how you remember, but we have made some updates to bring this content up to Destiny 2 standards. We don\u2019t want to spoil anything though; experience it for yourself starting May 22.\u00a0\n\n###It\u2019s a race\u00a0\n\nWorld First races have been exciting events over the last seven years since, well... we first kicked things off with Vault of Glass back in 2014. Back then, no one really knew what to expect from this new highly challenging cooperative activity. There was a mystery and excitement in the air that set the stage for all future races to come. With this being the first raid returning from the Destiny Content Vault, we asked ourselves, \u201cHow do we recapture or reimagine that moment?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nOur goal is to not fundamentally evolve this raid into something completely new. So, this will be the first race (outside of previous hard modes) where players have a broad understanding of what to expect while still encountering changes they\u2019ll have to adapt to.\u00a0\n\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019re shaking things up with a new type of World First race.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Vault of Glass will launch with Contest Mode ([explained here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47832)) enabled for 24 hours.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n   * You will need to be at 1300 Power to be at the cap for all of the encounters.\u00a0\n* Clearing Vault of Glass with Contest Mode active is the first step to access the new Challenge Mode in the Director and the Tempo's Edge Triumph.\u00a0\n* Completing Tempo's Edge, a curated list of Triumphs, in this newly unlocked Challenge Mode, will be how a fireteam crosses the World First finish line and claims their prize.\n* To enforce the Triumph requirements in the Challenge Mode, your team will wipe if you fail the success conditions during each encounter.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat prize, you ask? We decided to make a belt for the occasion, but also wanted to respect the Guardians who were the first to be victorious in the vault nearly seven years ago. These belts will have a silver aesthetic and will have the clan name of the OG World First fireteam featured.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150569/JB_VOG_RaidBelt_Teaser.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Lt6dvSZ.jpg)\n\n\nChallenge Mode and the Tempo\u2019s Edge Triumph will only be available for the first 24 hours and then that node will disappear. The encounter challenges will become available again later in the season. We will have a full array of raid rewards and Bungie Rewards associated with Vault of Glass as well as an emblem available for completing it. We\u2019ll cover all of the details on how to get them soon.\u00a0\n\n\nOne quick thing to call out is that the opening area of the Vault of Glass will now be a private space for your fireteam, so don\u2019t expect any backup from wandering Guardians. You won\u2019t be able to abandon the mission and explore Venus (as tempting as that is). There is only one way forward and that is into the Vault.\u00a0\n\n\nAs with any World First race, we will be following along and keeping an eye on the action as it unfolds.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Linear Voop Rifles\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150569/03292018_sandbox_header.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RAwl2jL.jpg)\n\n\nA few weeks ago, we talked about [upcoming changes we are making to the sandbox](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50237). We started by looking at a few weapon types that were a little hot and that needed some cooling down. Today, we are focusing on some upcoming buffs coming next Season. **Weapons Feature Lead Chris Proctor** is here with the details and goals behind what we have planned.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Heavy Weapon Roles Chris Proctor**: Hello everyone, it's great to be back! First, I want to share how we think about weapon roles, with Heavy weapons in particular. We intend each weapon to excel in one or two areas, making them optimal choices in particular situations, based on target type or engagement distance. For Heavy weapons, this is how we intend the weapons to fill the roles of add clear, single target damage, and burst damage:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Explanation of roles:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Add Clear**: Clearing weaker enemies faster than you could\u00a0 with a primary ammo weapon. For most content, primaries do the add clear job\u00a0 perfectly well, so this is most useful in high difficulty PvE, such as Grandmaster Nightfalls, where you sometimes benefit from the rapid-fire damage of a Machine Gun, or the group clearing potential of a Rocket Launcher.\n&gt;* **Single Target Damage**: Burning down a boss.\n&gt;* **Burst Damage**: Burning down a champion quickly, or for bosses with multiple damage phases, clearing a phase quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;How weapons map to roles:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Sword**: Ammo efficient add clear, single target sustained damage, secondary burst damage (at the cost of being next to a dangerous target).\u00a0\n&gt;* **Rocket Launcher**: Burst damage, secondary add clear.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Machine Gun**: Ammo efficient add clear, secondary single target sustained damage.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;   * We expect to adjust Machine Guns in a future Season, they're not currently hitting this target.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Linear Fusion Rifles**: Single target sustained damage (where the target has a handy crit spot), secondary burst damage.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Drum Grenade Launchers**: Burst add clear, secondary single target damage.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Exotic Snipers**: Single target sustained damage (where the target has a handy crit spot).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;A few examples of how we've used Heavy weapons in playtests of high difficulty content, or when we've played Grandmaster Nightfalls (GMs) in retail:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Linear Fusion Rifles**: Burning down Champions, boss damage where the boss has a crit spot, or with Divinity.\n&gt;* **Rocket Launcher**: Burst damage against Champions or bosses (particularly with Lasting Impression), clearing clumped-up waves of tough adds.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Machine Gun**:\u00a0Breaking matching shields in GMs where our other weapons can't do the trick, using a Machine Gun instead of a Primary Weapon in a Heavy ammo-rich situation where your Primary and Special weapons are not rapid-fire (e.g. Le Monarque + Succession + whatever Machine Gun has a useful damage type in this GM.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Balance Philosophy\n&gt;\n&gt;There are two approaches we take to making balance changes:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Big Swings**: Make a big change that we believe will immediately encourage new player behavior. Most useful when we need to nerf or buff something hard enough that everyone can tell that it's happened, with the expectation that we may need to dial the tuning in in a later release. Examples: the 120 Hand Cannon buff in Beyond Light, or the Rocket Launcher buff in Season of the Chosen.\n&gt;* **Incremental Changes**: Take something that we feel isn't far from where it needs to be, and nudge it a little at a time. Most useful when we don't want to overcorrect and make something overpowered,\u00a0 or when we don't want to make a change with huge test wake and would prefer smaller, safer changes. Examples: The Precision Auto Rifle change outlined below, or the Season of the Arrivals High Impact Pulse Rifle change.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In most releases we make changes of both types, and which we choose for a given feature depends on how much time we have to test and iterate on a change, how many changes are already in a release, and how close we think a feature is to being balanced already.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###A Small Note on Damage Falloff Distances\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;When we call out changes to damage falloff distance, we always do so according to a weapon's base damage falloff (i.e., hip-fire). Damage falloff distance increases differently based on a weapon's zoom, so for example the Fusion Rifle distance changes described below, or the Hand Cannon distance changes called out previously will be higher when zoomed.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###Weapon Archetypes\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;**Precision (450 rpm) Auto Rifles**: This subfamily fell behind other Auto Rifles in the Auto Rifle tuning last year, so damage has been increased to be closer to the time to kill of the others.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Increased Precision (450 rpm) Auto Rifle damage per bullet from 17 to 18.\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;Rares**: We added a Rare Machine Gun and Bow to the World Loot Pool recently, but we didn't have any obtainable Linear Fusion Rifles or Breech Grenade Launchers and wanted to make sure these archetypes were also easily accessible.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Added existing but unobtainable rare Linear Fusion Rifle and Breech Grenade Launchers to the World Loot Pool.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;**\n&gt;\n&gt;Linear Fusion Rifles**: These are an unpopular choice in PvE, largely because other weapons do their intended job (single target sustained damage) better or more efficiently, without the requirement of landing all precision hits. We want to keep the LFRs focus on precision damage but decided to increase the precision damage to make them more competitive, and increase reserves to give them more staying power. Note that we have seen plenty of suggestions to move some or all LFRs out of the Heavy slot, but this is a substantial amount of work and a balance risk for PvP, due to the difficulty of balancing Sniper Rifles (as instant-shot weapons) against LFRs (with charge time), with wildly varying flinch and aim assist values, and reduces weapon diversity in the Heavy slot. It's still a possibility for sometime in the future though, if tuning them as Heavy weapons doesn't have the desired effect.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Increased precision damage by 15%\n&gt;* Increased reserve ammo by 20%\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Fusion Rifles**: The recent buff to Fusion Rifle ranges had the side effect of making the best subfamily for PvP (high impact) even better, so we've decided to bring low range-stat Fusion Rifles up a fair bit.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Increased damage falloff start distance for Fusion Rifles, no effect on 100 range stat, +2m on 0 range stat.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###Perks\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;**Subsistence**: When we made this perk, we were experimenting with unusual downsides for powerful perks, but ultimately decided that reducing reserves wasn't an interesting tradeoff. We also wanted to be able to put the perk on Special and Heavy weapons, where reducing reserves would feel terrible. Submachine Guns were granting a much smaller magazine fraction than Auto Rifles, so we fixed that at the same time.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* No longer reduces reserve ammunition.\u00a0\n&gt;* Submachine Guns now receive the same ammo fraction per takedown that Auto Rifles do (was 10%, like most weapons, now 17%, same as Auto Rifles).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**High-Impact Reserves and Under Pressure**: Due to technical constraints at the time these were created, the trigger condition for these is on projectile impact (i.e., the bonus won't take effect until you fire the weapon once), but we have more flexibility in perk activators now.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* These are now active as long as their conditions are met.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Unrelenting**: This was hard to trigger in difficult content, and the health awarded was hard to perceive.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Now easier to trigger in PvE (immediate trigger on majors) and heals 20% more.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sympathetic Arsenal**: Isn't appealing enough for many players as it is, but is useful in niche situations, so we decided on a small buff to sweeten it a little.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Now grants +20 reload in addition to its primary effect.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dragonfly**: It always bugged us that Dragonfly wouldn't proc on every enemy you could finish with a precision hit.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Now works on heavy shanks and servitors, and occurs even faster than after the Season of the Chosen fix.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Hip-fire Grip**: We're being careful not to over-buff this, since when hip-fire is too effective it changes the game significantly, so we're just bumping this a bit more over the Season of Arrivals buff to make it a more useful option.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* +1 degrees precision hip fire angle threshold, +1.2x reticle stickiness falloff distance.\u00a0\n&gt;* One degree doesn't seem like that much, but for reference Hand Cannon aim assist cone angle is 2.5 degrees at 0 AA, to 3 degrees at 100 AA, and you can feel the difference between a 90 AA hand cannon and a 100 AA hand cannon (a 0.05-degree increase), so a small difference can be significant.\u00a0\n&gt;* Note that precision hip-fire angle caps at the aim down sights aim assist cone angle.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Iron Grip, Iron Gaze, Iron Reach**: We were cautious when making stat bump perks in Season of Arrivals, not wanting to break weapon stat ranges at too low a cost, but the penalties these shipped with were too much now that we've seen them in the wild.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Reduced secondary stat penalty from -40 to -30.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Osmosis and Elemental Capacitor**: We didn't have time to address these when Stasis came into being, but always wanted them to work correctly when playing a Stasis subclass.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Osmosis now switches the weapon to Stasis damage when playing a Stasis subclass - this should work for any mechanics that ask for Stasis damage (but not for Stasis ability damage).\u00a0Also created stasis VFX for all weapon types that Osmosis can appear on (more coming later).\n&gt;* Elemental Capacitor with a Stasis subclass grants +recoil direction and reduces ADS move speed penalty.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**No Distractions**: Because of an Exotic change below, and the Sniper Rifle flinch changes in Season of the Chosen, we wanted to make No Distractions a more appealing option for combatting flinch.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Reduced trigger time from 1.5s to 1s and increased flinch reduction from 30% to 35%.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Celerity and Bottomless Grief**: We addressed these specifically in an earlier TWAB, but here are the buffs again. Note that we buffed the perks themselves, so these changes will apply to your existing drops of these weapons (these being alternate perks on Adept weapons can't be applied retroactively though).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Celerity: Now always grants +20 to handling and +20 to reload in addition to the triggered effect.\u00a0\n&gt;* Bottomless Grief: Now always grants +30 to magazine in addition to the triggered effect.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Thresh**: This change is already live and not a buff so much as a bug fix (Thresh unintentionally only worked in PvP for certain weapons in Beyond Light) but Thresh has worked for all weapon types in PvP since Season of the Chosen launch.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Mods\n&gt;\n&gt;**Adept Mag, Adept Targeting**: Same reasoning as the Iron Banner perks, we were cautious initially but think it's fine to reduce the penalties for these perks having seen them in action.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Reduced secondary stat penalty from -20 to -15.\u00a0\n&gt;* Fixed Adept Mag not granting reserves when applied to a Sword.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Adept Counterbalance**: This didn't feel like enough of an upgrade over standard Counterbalance Stock to be worthwhile.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Increased recoil direction benefit.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Exotics\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;**MIDA Multitool**: We've seen many requests to switch this from Outlaw to something more useful, and one thing we've observed is MIDA losing fights to weapons that cause more flinch, so here we go.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Changed the catalyst perk from Outlaw to No Distractions.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Hawkmoon**: Increased priority of Paracausal Charge and Paracausal Shot buff text (this was sometimes dropping off the bottom of the list).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###The Future\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Sometime further into Season 14, we expect to touch the following:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**All Shotguns**: We don't expect the change to the two dominant Shotguns (replacing Quickdraw with Surplus) and nerfing Quickdraw to really move the needle on Shotgun usage overall in PvP. We agree with some of the comments that weapon usage is not only dependent on tuning, but that map design is also a factor. However, we want more weapons to be viable on all maps, and we can achieve this through tuning, giving other Special weapons room to excel. Specifics coming later.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dead Man's Tale**: With the upcoming nerf to 120 Hand Cannon range, we expect to see a surge in Dead Man's Tale usage (which is already high). We had enough moving pieces in Season 14 that we didn't want to try to squeeze this in at the same time , but we have a change ready to go that reins in its ability to challenge Sniper Rifles, 120 Hand Cannons and Scout Rifles while in hip-fire without detracting from the fantasy of the weapon.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Fusion Rifles**: As with some of our other changes, we don't want to bump these too much too fast, so will follow up if needed.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Go for Gold\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9rHDq5Y.gif)\n\n\nLet\u2019s kick it over to our Player Support team who have an update on today's update and maybe even more updates to update you on.

But as the bonuses continue to stack,\u00a0 the daily races are getting closer. We saw Warlocks take their first Guardian Games \u201cW\u201d on Wednesday, and \u201cwe\u201d couldn\u2019t be \u201cprouder.\u201d Will Warlocks winning Wednesday mark a turning point or are Titans taking Tuesday only a matter of time? Maybe it\u2019ll be Hunters who put a stop to all this wordplay \u2013 only time will tell. There are still two thrilling weeks left and its anyone\u2019s game.\u00a0\n\n\nLess than two weeks to go before we usher in a new Season.

The Guardian Games have begun! Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks throughout the system have begun competing for gold placement each day of the Games. A few of us here at the studio have pledged to help Warlocks as they attempt to prevent a sweeping win by Titans for the second year in a row. Hunters are already showing promise with some early wins. Maybe they learned from last year that they\u2019ll need to compete for more than a single day to win the trophy. Who will take the win? Only time will tell!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n*[Editor's Note: Hunters will prevail!]\u00a0*\n\n\n*[Editor\u2019s Editor\u2019s Note: You misspelled \u201cTitans\u201d]\u00a0*\n\n\n*[DMG\u2019s Note: Warlocks may actually have a chance this year. Calm down everyone. Let\u2019s get back to the TWAB.]\u00a0*\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/RbvCFxOVqno)\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an additional challenge during the Games, the final Grandmaster Nightfalls required for the Gilded Conqueror title are now available. If you\u2019ve been procrastinating a bit, all featured strikes of the Season are available at Grandmaster difficulty.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore we move on to some juicy details about Armor Synthesis, we want to give a quick Public Service Announcement about the future of Nightfall weapons. Next Season, three new Legendary weapons will be added to Nightfall rotation, which will also receive Adept treatment when Grandmasters become available. As such, Palindrome, Shadow Price, and The S.W.A.R.M. will be taking a hiatus for the first half of the Season. When they return, all three will be available as potential post-game rewards when completing Nightfalls on featured weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148944/S13_Strike_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BSWI8lZ.jpg)\n\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking to farm some Palindromes, this week will be your last chance to do so for a bit until they return! Stay tuned for a future TWAB where we show off next Season\u2019s hotness, coming soon to a Nightfall near you.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Armor Synthesis &amp; Guardian Appearance\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the launch of Destiny 1, we\u2019ve seen requests for a transmog system. After some development time, buckets of sweat, and a few happy tears, we\u2019re happy to introduce Armor Synthesis to Destiny 2. Ada-1 will be returning to the Tower to help Guardians customize their appearance in a brand-new way. Today, we'll be explaining how this feature will work, and how you can work your way towards your favorite looks. Quick note, many of the following screenshots were from test builds, so some things may look slightly different when released!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150505/Warlock.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lEWkpRw.png)\n\n\nBefore we get too deep, here\u2019s a quick list of steps that players will take to convert their armor appearance into Universal Armor Ornaments:\u00a0\n\n\n1. Defeat enemies to earn **Synthstrand**.\u00a0\n1. Spend Synthstrand on bounties to earn **Synthcord**.\u00a0\n1. Convert Synthcord at the Loom in the Tower into **Synthweave**.\u00a0\n1. Use Synthweave to convert an unlocked armor appearance (Legendary quality or lower) from Collections into a **Universal Armor Ornament**.\u00a0\n\n\nTo start, players will begin earning Synthstrand when defeating enemies in Destiny 2. After earning 150 Synthstrand , players may visit Ada-1 in the Tower to acquire class-specific bounties, which will reward Synthcord.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen developing this feature, an early goal was to ensure players could earn Synthweave through numerous activities in Destiny 2. That way, players who spend most of their time in the Crucible could continue to do so and still engage with Armor Synthesis. There will be five categories of Armor Synthesis bounties: Vanguard, Crucible, Gambit, Destinations, or Raids and Dungeons. Here are a few examples of bounties that you will see:\u00a0\n\n\n* Vanguard\u00a0\n\n\n   * Complete playlists strikes using specific subclasses.\u00a0\n   * Accumulate points in Nightfall strikes.\u00a0\n* Crucible\u00a0\n\n\n   * Capture zones in Crucible Control matches.\u00a0\n   * Complete Crucible matches and defeat opponents using specific damage types as a team.\u00a0\n* Gambit\u00a0\n\n\n   * Send and defeat blockers in Gambit.\u00a0\n   * Defeat Primeval Envoys, high value targets and Primevals in Gambit.\u00a0\n* Destinations\u00a0\n\n\n   * Defeat Nightmares on any destination or in Nightmare Hunts.\u00a0\n   * Defeat bosses while defending the Blind Well within the Dreaming City.\u00a0\n* Raids and Dungeons\u00a0\n\n\n   * Complete the final encounter of any Raid or Dungeon.\u00a0\n   * Generate Orbs of Power in raids or dungeons.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you pick up the wrong bounty, some of the Synthstrands will be refunded if you choose to abandon it. But not the full amount, so think carefully before abandoning!\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150505/EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9cN3cRa.png)\n\n\n**How many of these can you earn?\u00a0**\n\nPlayers may earn up to ten Synthweave per class, per Season. Except in Season of [REDACTED]...\n\n\nTo celebrate the introduction of Armor Synthesis, in Season of [REDACTED], players may earn ten additional Synthweave per class through the introductory experience. In total, during Season of [REDACTED] players may earn up to 20 Synthweave per class, which can either be used to convert four full sets to ornaments, or 20 specific items.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a quick example for the Hunters out there, that could mean you unlock four armor pieces, plus sixteen individual cloaks to swap between depending on your mood.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150505/EN_1.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/quoyVid.png)\n\n\n**Please Note: Some exceptions apply.\u00a0**\n\nUniversal Ornaments may only be applied to Legendary armor pieces. Exotic armor pieces cannot take the appearance of alternate armor, as we want to maintain their appearance for players to quickly identify and understand what Exotic perks a player may have in all activities.\u00a0\n\n\nThere will also be a few exceptions at launch for Year-1 Armor Ornaments due to technical constraints, but we are currently working on solutions for a future Season. These exceptions include:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Year-1 Armor Ornaments\u00a0\n\n   * Vanguard\u00a0\n   * Crucible\u00a0\n   * Iron Banner\u00a0\n   * Faction Rallies\u00a0\n   * Prestige Raids\u00a0\n   * Trials of the Nine\u00a0\n\n\nOrnaments can still be applied if the base armor piece is from an activity that the ornament originates. As an example, if a player owns Crucible ornaments from Curse of Osiris, they may be applied to Crucible armor pieces at no cost. However, these ornaments cannot be applied to Seasonal armor.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, all base armor appearances from 2018 and 2019 Solstice of Heroes events will be available for Armor Synthesis. However, due to an issue where 2018 and 2019 glows cannot be socketed alongside armor appearances in the new Guardian Appearance system, the glows will not be supported. Solstice 2020 armor glows were developed with the Guardian Appearance system in mind, and players will retain the white armor glow if it was earned during the event. Subclass based glows will continue to function on their Universal Ornaments as well.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150505/Titan.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bawyQo2.jpg)\n\n\n**Eververse\u00a0**\n\nEververse will also offer Synthweave Templates for direct purchase through the Guardian Appearance screen. Players may either purchase a single Synthweave, or they may purchase a five-piece bundle.\u00a0\n\n\n**Item**|**Silver Cost**|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\nSynthweave Template (1 Token)|300|\nSynthweave Template Bundle (5 Tokens)|1000|\n*For reference, Universal Armor Ornament Bundles cost 1500 Silver.\u00a0*\n\n\nTo avoid mistaken purchases, Synthweave Templates from Eververse can be applied to any class.\u00a0\n\n\n**Let\u2019s talk Shaders\u00a0**\n\nThrough the Guardian Appearances screen, we took an opportunity to improve the shader experience. Currently, shaders are one-time use consumables that must be repurchased from Collections for Glimmer or Legendary Shards.\u00a0\n\n\nStarting next Season, all unlocked shaders will be visible on the Guardian Appearance screen when hovering over the shader bucket. Players may apply shaders for 500 Glimmer per armor piece. Additionally, we\u2019ve added the often requested \u201capply all\u201d button for shaders, which will cost 2500 Glimmer total. This is the same Glimmer cost to purchase shaders right now, but we\u2019ve done away with the Legendary Shards requirement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150505/EN_2.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bpdGcmr.png)\n\n\nShaders will continue to be earned through various activities in Destiny 2 or can be purchased using Bright Dust or Silver from Eververse. With the update to shaders, we\u2019ll be increasing their cost from 40 Bright Dust to 300 Bright Dust. This will continue to be a one-time purchase and will appear in the Guardian Appearance menu when unlocked. In celebration of Armor Synthesis, a Year-1 Eververse shader bundle will also be available in the Eververse for Glimmer, no Silver required!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150505/Hunter.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zP2hank.png)\n\n\nAnd there you have it. We\u2019re excited for the addition of Armor Synthesis starting in just a few short weeks.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Spicy Prime Ramen Rewards\u00a0\n\nThis week wasn\u2019t just the start of Guardian Games, but a fresh month of Prime Rewards!

Titans having invisible arms, Contender Cards taking up two slots in quest inventory, and a few other things. We\u2019ve deployed some fixes, but are still tracking a few known issues.\u00a0\n\n\n**This is their report.**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**SEASON OF THE CHOSEN SEAL PURCHASE\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Acquisition of all the scannables in the Presage mission is required for the Season of the Chosen Seal. The scannables are collected over a period of three weeks \u2013 players need to collect all the scannables in each week and claim the associated Triumph before the weekly reset. With the following weekly reset, the next set of scannables will be available in the Presage mission.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Because a period of three weeks is required to collect all the scannables, players have until the weekly reset on April 27 to collect the first week\u2019s scannables and claim the associated Triumph if they want to be able to purchase the Season of the Chosen Seal from the Bungie Store.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, players must also begin purchasing Chosen mods from the War Table before the weekly reset on April 27 if they want to purchase the Seal because there are six mods total that must be acquired.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**WEEKLY KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* The Titan Contender Eververse Armor set makes the player's body invisible in first person.\u00a0\n* Certain shaders may erroneously remove the glow from the Eververse Warlock Guardian Games Universal Ornament set.\u00a0\n* The One Fell Strike Triumph must be completed in Vanguard or Nightfall Strike Playlists and claimed before a strike ends. We\u2019re working to allow it to complete in the Guardian Games Playlist.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Contender Cards are no longer taking up extra space in player Quest inventories. Players may need to visit the Tower and return to Orbit for their inventory to update.\u00a0\n* Zero Hour's SCRAP CF-717-91 Exotic ship no longer fires its middle four engines.\u00a0\n* The Festival of the Lost Hunter Chthonic Grips shows the ornament glow when inspecting the hand, but it doesn't appear when running around.\u00a0\n* Ophidian Aspect's ornament, Coaxial Bonds, no longer displays SIVA particles on the Warlock's right arm.\u00a0\n* Metropolitan Frigate ship wing animation displays poorly when warping to a destination.\u00a0\n* The Quick Charge mod doesn't increase the ready speed of Shotguns at all.\u00a0\n* Mida Mini-Tool doesn't show Kill Tracking column when Masterworked.\u00a0\n* The Region Chest in Trostland in the EDZ shows as unclaimed even when associated Region Chest Triumph is complete.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our Known Issues article.

Know what? It\u2019s well deserved. Everyone underestimated them before the 2020 Games began, and they showed up in force. Will this year be different? We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.

Hunters, I\u2019m sorry, but it may actually be nice lobbing Nova Bombs for the duration of the event. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need my help snagging the win, so long as you all *show up*. If a potential Titan loss isn\u2019t enough to get everyone out of bed, maybe the conversation around Armor Synthesis will be motivation to hop through some activities to round out our fashion collections. I\u2019ve already started poking through quite a few armor sets, planning out my looks for the start of next Season.\u00a0\n\n\nGood luck to all, no matter which class you\u2019re playing. Hope you enjoy the games, and we\u2019ll see you out there in the wild.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 2049468, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 4/22/2021", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/mw9tfy/this_week_at_bungie_4222021/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1618524149, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/mrp8om/this_week_at_bungie_4152021/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mrp8om", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_css_class": "bungie", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Bungie"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2f13ba30-3d46-11e9-8cd7-0e03d8e4b5da", "link_flair_text": "Bungie", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 638, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/mrp8om/this_week_at_bungie_4152021/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "-C47oqJd1DIBoUaI1V_5STVtqeCiqd3K2Ft4MkbvEl0", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W9bJl0DdR9F0KBgOSXQ8LANhcnZtyq5cBQ1JZ8WnPM8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66af29adda5b4ee0b9e0406c9f02d88b7eb54c27", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W9bJl0DdR9F0KBgOSXQ8LANhcnZtyq5cBQ1JZ8WnPM8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6136bcd0e67a93e6ce170b98cac1b5b4d017c62e", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W9bJl0DdR9F0KBgOSXQ8LANhcnZtyq5cBQ1JZ8WnPM8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90765ff6ce65e76df343008c9a9f2b126a9a5f51", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W9bJl0DdR9F0KBgOSXQ8LANhcnZtyq5cBQ1JZ8WnPM8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8610ca0a7359c88c175dd8e9d883c0b677eeecde", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W9bJl0DdR9F0KBgOSXQ8LANhcnZtyq5cBQ1JZ8WnPM8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=688741c54fa3966b33e9c938a3aae9c8def4dc81", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W9bJl0DdR9F0KBgOSXQ8LANhcnZtyq5cBQ1JZ8WnPM8.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f9079d7dfb8e369446a262472cfcf8088314421", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1080, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/W9bJl0DdR9F0KBgOSXQ8LANhcnZtyq5cBQ1JZ8WnPM8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d50ea5da09efd2f3d7478c311d281494cde4c0f0", "width": 1920}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1618524160, "score": 1, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50247\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we warm up.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSpring is here and competition is in the air. The second annual Guardian Games are kicking off on April 20. The theme of the event returns, pitting the classes against each other in a friendly competition to showcase their skills in combat. Last year, Titans dominated the field for nearly the entire event. Can Warlocks or Hunters bounce back and dethrone those gargantuan punching machines? Time will tell.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf you are new to Guardian Games or need a quick refresher, [this article is a great place to start](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/GuardianGames). In today's TWAB we'll get into some of the changes for this year\u2019s event. But before we do, let's check out the hype reel.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/RbvCFxOVqno)\n\n\nLast year, we received a lot of feedback on how the overall scoring worked. You can read through [this post](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48993) for a refresher, but the tl;dr is we had class-specific score weighting to account for the difference in class population. We did this to make sure that Hunters didn\u2019t have a huge advantage because of... well, how many Hunters there are. This year, we won\u2019t be doing any initial weighting on the scoring. Everyone\u2019s points will count the same... at the start. How the scoring will work this year.\u00a0\n\n\nMedals have the following values:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Bronze: 1 Point\u00a0\n* Silver: 2 Points\u00a0\n* Gold: 5 Points\u00a0\n* Platinum: 15 Points\u00a0\n\n\nWe still have to account for different class population, so this year the class that comes in third place each day gets a permanent 10% bonus on scoring going forward.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019ve tested this new scoring system using last year\u2019s data and a few other data sets and it seems to provide a more competitive Guardian Games where we see different classes winning throughout the event. Hunters will likely win early on because of their population advantage but as the bonuses kick in, the competition should tighten up quickly.\u00a0\n\n\n###New Guardian Games Playlist\u00a0\n\nAnother new addition to this year\u2019s event is the Guardian Games Strikes Playlist. This is like the standard Vanguard Strikes Playlist but will group players together by class. This feeds into the Laurel collecting mechanic where players have a chance at bonus Laurels when they pick up a Laurel generated by a player of the same class.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n###Modifiers\u00a0\n\nThis new playlist will have gameplay modifiers added based on the previous day\u2019s class standing. Classes will get a beneficial modifier tied to gold, silver, and bronze placement.\u00a0\n\n\n* Gold: Health, shields, and recovery are increased. Kinetic weapons deal more damage.\u00a0\n* Silver: Melee abilities recharge faster. Elemental damage increased from Guardian sources. More Heavy ammo available.\u00a0\n* Bronze: Grenade abilities deal more damage and recharge much faster. Elemental damage increased from Guardian sources.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are also negative modifiers added to the playlist to make things a little more challenging for the leaders. The gold class gets two modifiers, and the silver class gets one. These modifiers are themed around the classes that finished lower on the podium.\u00a0\n\n\n|**Bronze**|**Silver**|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n**Titan**\n\n|Combatant melee attacks deal more damage.\u00a0|Combatant melee attacks deal significantly more damage.\u00a0|\n**Warlock**|Incoming damage increased while airborne.\u00a0|Incoming damage significantly increased while airborne.\u00a0|\n**Hunter**|Radar is disabled.|Radar is disabled and combatants don't flinch when damaged.\u00a0|\n\n\nSilver classes only get the modifier from the bronze class below them. Gold classes get a combination of both silver and bronze.\n\n\nThematically, we\u2019re going for an experience where the Guardian Games Strike Playlist is the venue for players hoping to jockey their classes\u2019 podium placement as it will likely be one of the most efficient ways to earn Laurels.\u00a0\n\n\n###Medal Case\u00a0\n\nYou will receive a medal case from Eva to store your hardware until you are ready to visit the podium in the Tower to bank them for your team. Once you have the maximum medals for a certain type in your case, make sure you go turn them as any more earned for that type will be lost. Turning in medals will give you a chance at receiving an event package depending on the medal type.\u00a0\n\n\n###Contender Card\u00a0\n\nThis year we are introducing a new way to earn points for your team called Contender Cards. You will be able to pick these up from Eva in exchange for Laurels and can have one active at any given time. Completing objectives in strikes, Crucible, and Gambit will grant a Gold Medal upon completion.\u00a0\n\n\nThere is also a special Platinum Contender Card that will focus on completing objectives in Nightfalls, Survival, and Trials. This will be the only way to earn Platinum Medals. Completing a Platinum Card will earn you All-Star status and a special reward at the next podium ceremony.\u00a0\n\n\nMake sure you complete your Platinum Contender Card before daily reset on Friday if you want to lock in your All-Star status for the weekend.\u00a0\n\n\n###Podium Ceremony\n\nEvery weekend there will be a special ceremony where you will be able show off a glow from your class item depending on your class\u2019 standing that week.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Third place receives a bronze glow.\u00a0\n* Second place receives a silver glow.\u00a0\n* First place receives a gold glow.\u00a0\n* All-Stars receive a platinum glow.\u00a0\n\n\nWe will be throwing a special final weekend closing ceremony in the Tower that will be live from May 7 to May 11 to celebrate the winning class!\u00a0\n\n###Rewards\u00a0\n\nAs with any event, there will be new loot to grab. At the start of the event, you will get is a new class item from Zavala \u2013 these are required to participate in the games. Your old class items won't work for this event, even though they still look cool. Super cool.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_Gear_Titan_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1CBqOYk.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_Gear_Warlock_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/B8XcxLz.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_Gear_Hunter_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yI1GNQ0.jpg)\n\n\nThere will be a new Exotic Sparrow you can earn during the event because every Guardian can use a new set of wheels... OK maybe not wheels since they hover, but you get the point. It\u2019s a cool vehicle that you can drive... fly... drift? Yeah. You can definitely drift them.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JB_Guardian_Games_2021_Sparrow_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GS5OxDc.jpg)\n\n\nAnyway, there will also be new emblems and shaders to collect and Heir Apparent is back for anyone who didn\u2019t get it last year. Proud owners of the tanky Exotic Machine Gun now have a new catalyst to earn. If you want to roleplay as Valus Ta'arc, this catalyst will provide even beefier shields for you as you cabal-stomp your way through the battlefield.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_HeirApparent_Triumphant_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UmZcIfO.jpg)\n\n\nThere will also be new Eververse collectibles including, but not limited to, a new Universal Ornament armor set.\u00a0 At Beyond Light's release, we said we would be working to make future Universal Ornament sets more accepting of shaders. New tech allows us to achieve this change more easily and the GG sets are a great example.\u00a0 Here is a peek at some of the offerings.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_Class_All_TWAB.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/v8AiMXI.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_PlushShell_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/k3gnJ4c.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_RefreshingShell_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1JWvjKb.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_PaceSetter_16-9_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2YYisaL.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_TheFrontrunner_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rn766rH.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_VictorysHerald_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/orMYUQO.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/JJ_HalfVolleyShell_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Xia6Rzg.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Bungie Rewards\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150236/GG_BR_1920x1080.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kXbyJTY.png)\n\n\nYour chance for glory and rewards begins next week, but Guardians can get a preview of the Bungie Rewards starting now.

That kicked off a fun Dino vs Monsters moment and we want to do something similar for weapon ornaments.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019ve identified 12 weapons as candidates for your consideration. You can pick up to three that you would like to see have new ornaments created in the future. We\u2019re asking for your suggestions super early in development and plan on completing this early next year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Crimson\u00a0\n* Fighting Lion\u00a0\n* Graviton Lance\u00a0\n* Le Monarque\u00a0\n* Merciless\u00a0\n* Riskrunner\u00a0\n* Skyburner's Oath\u00a0\n* Sunshot\u00a0\u00a0\n* Sweet Business\u00a0\n* Telesto\u00a0\n* Trinity Ghoul\u00a0\n* Vigilance Wing\u00a0\n\n###[Click here to take our brief survey and cast your votes!](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wpnornsurvey)\n\nWhich weapons will win out? We know there is a bit of a cult following behind Fighting Lion, but then again, we see Le Monarque ornaments requested regularly. We will announce the results and which weapon ornaments we plan to make in a future TWAB.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Shader Shredding\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uT8ShFi.gif)\n\n\nLet's now throw it over to our Player Support experts with and update on ongoing issues and other important information on the state of the game.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[KNOWN ISSUES LIST](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054863011)\u00a0[#HELP FORUMS](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help)\u00a0[**BUNGIE HELP TWITTER**](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp?s=20)\n\n\n###PROVING GROUNDS NIGHTFALL\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEarlier this Season, we clarified that Beyond Light and the Season Pass would be required to play the Nightfall version of Proving Grounds. We have since made a changed these requirements, and access to the Proving Grounds Nightfall will now require either Beyond Light or the Season of the Chosen Season Pass. Players no longer need both to access the Nightfall.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nWe're working with our teams to update the Season of the Chosen calendar and future calendars to reflect this change.\u00a0\n\n\n###GUARDIAN GAMES KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBefore Guardian Games 2021 launches on April 20 we want players to be aware of certain issues and information before logging in the first time:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Players must wear their Guardian Games class item to generate Laurels and progress any Guardian Game bounties.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Previous Guardian Games class items (the Cunning Rivalry Cloak, Mighty Rivalry Mark, and Sage Rivalry Bond) will not generate Laurels or progress any Guardian Games bounties.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Class items acquired from Zavala are awarded at 1250 Power Level instead of 1300, which can be acquired from Eva.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Laurels do not drop on the ground in Gambit or Crucible and are instead rewarded directly to players.\u00a0 \u00a0\n* Unrecovered Laurels do not go to the Postmaster and must be picked up to count.\u00a0\u00a0\n* If the Medal Case is full, Medals earned through claiming Triumphs will be lost.\u00a0\u00a0\n* The Laurel acquisition step of Heir Apparent Exotic Quest only counts Laurels picked up off the ground.\u00a0\n* Players will not be able to deposit Medals if they were acquired in the Tower after players have already deposited Medals of the same rarity. Players can return to orbit and head back to the Tower to deposit those Medals.\u00a0\n* Certain shaders may erroneously remove the glow from the Eververse Warlock Guardian Games Universal Ornament set.\n\n\nAs always, we will be monitoring player reports on our Help Forum at Bungie.net and will be updating our Top Issues article as big issues arise. For more information, please visit our [Guardian Games support page](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360048722852-Destiny-2-Guardian-Games%22%20/).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n###STEAM DATAGRAM RELAY\n\nOver the past few weeks, we have expanded SDR coverage to Steam, Xbox and PlayStation consoles. As a result, players may encounter an increase in Beaver errors.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you receive additional errors or connection issues, please post a report to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n###DISMANTLE YOUR SHADERS\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBeginning in Season 14 (launching May 11), we are overhauling our shader system and how shaders can be applied to armor. Due to the overhaul, shaders will become permanent unlocks, and all shaders in player inventories will be removed. We encourage everyone to dismantle their shaders before Season 14 begins to ensure that you receive Glimmer and Legendary Shards.\n\n\nMore information about our new shader system can be found here under: \u201c[Getting Reacquainted with Adelaide.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124)\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n###WEEKLY KNOWN ISSUES\n\nWhile we continue investigating various [known issues](https://help.bungie.net/hc/articles/360054863011-Destiny-2-Year-4-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\n\n\n\n* The Pit of Heresy solo flawless emblem, \u201cCrimson Echoes\u201d, is not tracking completions.\u00a0\n* Players can fall beneath a grate in the Proving Grounds strike and become trapped.\u00a0\n* The Assassin's Cowl Exotic Hunter helmet clips through the majority of Hunter cloaks.\u00a0\n* For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://help.bungie.net/hc/articles/360054863011-Destiny-2-Year-4-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information).

Remember, while it\u2019s fun to poke fun at the other classes and enjoy partaking in a friendly rivalry, at the end of the day we are all on the same team. Let's keep it cordial and not be poor sports, win or lose. So to my fellow Hunters, let's be very humble when we win the gold this year[.](https://i.imgur.com/UkhVXyT.jpg)\u00a0\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo\u00a0**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 2046690, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 4/15/2021", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/mrp8om/this_week_at_bungie_4152021/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617905059, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/mmxmri/this_week_at_bungie_4082021/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mmxmri", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_css_class": "bungie", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Bungie"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2f13ba30-3d46-11e9-8cd7-0e03d8e4b5da", "link_flair_text": "Bungie", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2543, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/mmxmri/this_week_at_bungie_4082021/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "dX1dFFFmEDq3m4tlX0Sy0doyLOzymTaIs8rickgITzk", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/f49qgfVfsjevoXzWL8Ddex_0wF4yYwFsdFKxzLAsQjg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=496c17da0e1b83fd9508b1e40e7be6978a91a6a9", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/f49qgfVfsjevoXzWL8Ddex_0wF4yYwFsdFKxzLAsQjg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46124b31beb703906e8b3ab2bf6e777f3aab3f82", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/f49qgfVfsjevoXzWL8Ddex_0wF4yYwFsdFKxzLAsQjg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4391ee74b8e29accde34757fac317b976f9cb2a", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/f49qgfVfsjevoXzWL8Ddex_0wF4yYwFsdFKxzLAsQjg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f0af5e44dbcf2d7faeaa64227ce9c95275df0b1", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/f49qgfVfsjevoXzWL8Ddex_0wF4yYwFsdFKxzLAsQjg.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27298ca9c726eb75c3515035acaa40d289101e5d", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/f49qgfVfsjevoXzWL8Ddex_0wF4yYwFsdFKxzLAsQjg.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=843b16e4678922040591f519f6f7a5bd0dfe89a0", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 2160, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/f49qgfVfsjevoXzWL8Ddex_0wF4yYwFsdFKxzLAsQjg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9179eef90102eacea896c75e57f067cc33ed88f6", "width": 3840}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1617905070, "score": 1, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50237\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we dive into the details.\n\n\nSeason of the Chosen has entered its second half.

We bring you our usual suspects \u2013 Christine, Mark, and Forrest \u2013 as they highlight how they are supporting their mental health as we all continue to stay safe and socially distanced.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Mark**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150161/mark_flieg_kilts_4_kids.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ctB2I7P.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Christine**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150161/IMG_8912.jpeg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kKGNa0T.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Forrest**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150161/Forrest_k4k_2021_2.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1EFhxOa.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Our hearts continue to go out to the children and families who are battling illness throughout the pandemic, which has left many RMHC families isolated and facing economic hardships during a time when community support means everything to them.

This will be your last opportunity to complete the Iron Sharpens Iron Seasonal Challenge, so get in there and smash some heads! If you\u2019re also trying to get your Power to 1325 for Grandmaster Nightfalls, don\u2019t forget the four Pinnacle-powered weekly bounties that Saladin offers.\u00a0\n\n\n**Iron Banner\u00a0**\n\n**Start: April 13 at 10:00 AM PST\u00a0**\n\n**End: April 20 at 10:00 AM PST\u00a0**\n\n\nBefore we go, we\u2019d like to take a moment to look forward in time. Season of [REDACTED] is coming in a few short weeks, and Saladin has a few new items up his sleeve for you to earn when the new season begins in May.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150161/S14_Iron_Banner_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jeTdj79.jpg)\n\n\nA familiar Hand Cannon and Sniper Rifle will be rejoining the fight, but two new weapons are also making their debut. Our goals moving forward are to continue bringing some Year-1 weapons up to speed with random rolls, but also bringing some new rewards into the fold when possible. This always depends a bit on what resources we have for a given Season, but we\u2019re looking forward to a few new Iron Banner-themed tools for your arsenal.\u00a0\n\n\nLooking even further out, we\u2019re planning new armor for Iron Banner. These sets won\u2019t appear for a few Seasons, but we have heard your desire for some new digs. Once we have more information, we\u2019ll let you know! Until then, we hope you enjoy the new weapons.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n##The Never-ending Search for Balance\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPrepping for Season of [REDACTED], we have a few changes that will be coming to the Destiny sandbox. This week, we\u2019ll be focusing on things that are hot, so to speak. Weapons and archetypes that need to be tuned in order to create breathing room for other aspects of the Destiny sandbox to shine. We\u2019re also planning quite a few buffs to underused perks, Linear Fusion Rifles, and more! The current plan is to cover perk and weapon buffs in an upcoming TWAB towards the end of April once they\u2019re solidified, but we wanted to get this information out earlier than normal to keep you all informed!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150161/Shotguns.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vwMrcTP.jpg)\n\n\nWithout further ado, **Weapons Feature Lead Chris Proctor** is here once again to lay out our goals with these upcoming changes and give you the nitty-gritty details.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Weapon Archetypes\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Aggressive (120 rpm) Hand Cannons** are very dominant in PvP, and we've received enough feedback that we want to rein them in a bit, without completely taking away their range benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * These weapons will now have damage and aim assist falloff distance reduced by between 2 and 4 meters, based on the Range stat.\u00a0\n&gt;   * This roughly halves the range buff they received in Beyond Light.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Vortex Frame Swords** -- With Falling Guillotine now viable forever, we need to adjust it a little, as its damage output is flat out higher than all other Legendary swords. With this change we allow it to keep its high damage output, but are reducing its full-reserves damage output by reducing the number of Heavy attacks you'll be able to perform.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Full energy Heavy attack ammo cost increased from 4 to 6.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Chip damage** -- Certain weapons (Swords and Bastion) bypass shields by varying amounts, which has caused numerous issues with Stasis-encased enemies, encounter mechanics, and other content.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * We have removed chip damage from Swords and Bastion.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Perks\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Quickdraw** -- This perk is intended to provide faster swap speed, but it also passively buffs handling by +100. This completely negates the downside of using low-handling weapons (such as Aggressive Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, and Hand Cannons), which isn't something we want to encourage. Those weapons should have downsides and working around those completely via a perk isn't healthy. We don't think allowing a fast-swap to the Shotgun subfamily with the highest one-hit-kill range is great either.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * The Handling bonus is now removed one second after switching to this weapon, or upon aiming down sights.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Replaced Quickdraw with Surplus on new and existing drops of Felwinter\u2019s Lie and Astral Horizon.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Frenzy** -- This perk has extremely high uptime in PvE, to the point where it is clearly a better choice than most other damage perks. We like the high uptime and want to preserve that, but want it to award less damage than harder to activate damage perks\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reduced bonus damage from +20 percent to +15 percent.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Reservoir Burst** -- Now increases magazine size in addition to its other effects, reduced full battery bonus damage from 33 percent to 25 percent.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Upcoming content requires revisiting the Power Level of a damage perk that can be activated simply by having a full magazine.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more...\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Exotics\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **The Lament** -- This weapon is a clear outlier for Sword damage, so for the health of Heavy weapon diversity, we're pulling it back a bit.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reduced damage of revved Heavy attack by approximately 16 percent.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Note that The Lament retains standard anti-barrier despite removing chip damage.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Bastion** -- Since we're removing chip damage, Bastion gets something else instead. We\u2019ve noticed increased feedback on Bastion and higher than normal usage in PvP, so are making a small change here and will revisit Bastion later.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Intrinsically staggers Unstoppable Champions.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Increased spread angle by 13 percent.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With all balance changes, we will continue to watch how they play once they're in the wild and will look to make further adjustments based on our observations and player feedback.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Suit Up\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ObuqmFi.gif)\n\n\nSometimes, the only thing standing between Guardians and a successful outing is a single armor piece. This week, a new Seasonal Challenge required some very specific gear for completion, and our Player Support team has the details on why some of you may have been missing out on progress.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**SUITED FOR COMBAT SEASONAL CHALLENGE\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This week we introduced the ninth week of Season of the Chosen Seasonal Challenges. One of the challenges, \u201cSuited for Combat,\u201d asked players to defeat targets anywhere in the system wearing a full set of armor, but it didn\u2019t clarify that the armor had to be the Praefectus Seasonal armor. Only the Praefectus Season of the Chosen armor will grant progress toward this challenge.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**\u201cINACTIVITY\u201d IN GRANDMASTER NIGHTFALLS\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Since the Grandmaster Nightfall was introduced, we noticed that some players who can\u2019t be revived will eventually get kicked out of the activity due to \u201cinactivity.\u201d To mitigate this issue in future Grandmaster Nightfalls, players should open their Character or Director screens and go through their menus to avoid being removed from activity. We are investigating a solution for this issue in a future Season.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**DISMANTLE YOUR SHADERS\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Beginning in Season 14 (launching May 11), we are overhauling our shader system and how shaders can be applied to armor. Due to the overhaul, shaders will become permanent unlocks, and all shaders in player inventories will be removed. We encourage everyone to dismantle their shaders before Season 14 begins to receive Glimmer and Legendary Shards.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;More information about our new shader system can be found here under: \u201c[Getting Reacquainted with Adelaide.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124)\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**TWITCH GIFT SUB BOUNTY REWARDS\u00a0\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who purchase Twitch gift subs to progress the associated viewer bounty in the Destiny 2 Official Twitch Extension may not see bounty progress appear immediately after purchase.

Some of my favorite conversations with coworkers have been talking through feedback on various perks, their viability in different activities throughout Destiny 2, and the ways in which the team could make them more desirable for players moving forward. We covered Celerity and Bottomless Grief last week, but we\u2019re all excited to look at things like Iron Grip, Subsistence, Unrelenting, and more. We'll have the full list, and detailed changes, ready for you to read through in just a few short weeks.\n\n\nBut outside of scintillating sandbox scoops, we still have a bit more to cover in the coming weeks. Guardian Games is almost on our doorstep. Transmog is right around the corner. Vault of Glass is on its way.

If you\u2019ve been playing, you\u2019re probably waiting for me to tell you something you don\u2019t already know, so let\u2019s get to it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Gear Up\u00a0\n\nWith the return of Ada-1 to the Tower in Season 14, we are introducing some small quality of life upgrades to a couple of our Tower vendors. First, in addition to being the primary vendor associated with the upcoming transmog system also known as Armor Synthesis, Ada-1 will become the vendor who delivers a variety of armor-focused items and upgrades. Each day, Ada-1 will now sell one randomly chosen armor mod from the general and armor slot (Helmet, Gauntlets, etc.) groups, and one randomly chosen Combat Style armor mod (chosen from the Charged with Light and Warmind Cell mod groups), which should make it easier for players who missed these in the past to get their hands on some of the armor mods from Year 3.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, on a weekly basis, Ada-1 will sell one armor set randomly chosen from the World Loot Pool, with a stat roll that also changes on a weekly basis. Finally, Ada-1 will also sell armor upgrade materials (Upgrade Modules, Enhancement Prisms, and Ascendant Shards) in the same way that the Banshee-44 does right now.\u00a0\n\n\nWith Ada-1 taking on armor responsibilities, Banshee-44 is getting a few revisions to his inventory as well. The Gunsmith will no longer sell armor mods, but will retain the rest of the items that he currently sells. Additionally, on a weekly basis, Banshee-44 will sell a selection of six weapons, randomly chosen from the weapons in the World Loot Pool (two weapons each from the Kinetic, Energy, and Power slots) with perk rolls on each weapon that are randomly determined at the start of the week. So, at each weekly reset when you log in, you can head to the Tower and see what the Gunsmith is selling, and maybe pick up a weapon you\u2019ve been looking for with a roll you are excited to use.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Last One Standing\u00a0\n\nWe have received some feedback on perks like Celerity and Bottomless Grief from players asking that they be added as intrinsic bonuses to Adept weapons. **Weapons Feature Lead Chris Proctor** is here to share some of our philosophy on these perks and a few changes we are planning.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Chris Proctor**: When we launched Trials of Osiris, we made a new origin-specific perk for Trials weapons: Celerity. This is a wildly powerful perk (+100 aim assist, handling, and reload \u2013 plus reduced recoil and spread \u2013 this perk is nothing to sneeze at.) with very low uptime.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We intended this to be great for clutch \"last Guardian standing\" plays in Trials specifically. And when it's active it IS very strong, but we found that a trigger condition that relies on failure generally feels pretty bad, and the power it grants doesn't negate that feeling. Players never like betting against themselves or their teams. Not only that, but the perk is useless outside of Trials (and a couple of other activities).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Sidenote: The Deep Stone Crypt origin perks were well-received, so while Celerity specifically didn't hit the mark, the idea still has legs.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In Beyond Light we introduced Adept weapons to Trials, wanting to try out a new system for aspirational weapons in a small set before rolling them out more broadly. We had three goals for Adept weapons:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Give players a tangible reward to aspire towards, with custom visuals and a unique name, letting them flex a little.\u00a0\n&gt;* Give players who've earned an Adept weapon a minor Power boost and some gameplay customization options (in the form of the improved Masterwork granting +3 to all other stats, and the ability to equip Adept mods).\u00a0\n&gt;* Do not make players who can't earn these weapons feel like they can't compete with players who have them (*cough*Not Forgotten*cough*).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We've seen all of your suggestions to make Celerity and Bottomless Grief intrinsic to Trials and Nightfall weapons, or only to the Adept versions, and I wanted to touch on this idea.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thematically this is a cool idea, and adds to the flavor that these perks can give their sources, but there are three problems:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* For performance reasons, we have a maximum number of perks that can run on a character at a time. Legendary weapons have a threshold per weapon, and many of them are right at the limit - adding a perk on top of that without taking one away causes Bad Things to Happen, in the form of random parts of perks turning off.\u00a0\n&gt;* Adding a new perk column to weapons from a specific source introduces power creep, and pretty soon we'd end up having to do the same to weapons from other sources.\u00a0\n&gt;* Adding a new perk column to ONLY Adept weapons would work against the third goal of Adept weapons, and we believe would feel bad for players dying to Adept weapons that are able to stack Celerity with things like Outlaw and Rampage.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In Season 14, we're making the following changes to Trials and Nightfall weapons, and their Adept versions (Note: This only applies to new drops of these weapons, not previous drops.):\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Nightfall weapons:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Bottomless Grief grants a permanently active +30 to Magazine.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Bottomless Grief is now a fixed alternate perk in the left column on Adept drops of Nightfall weapons (i.e. you can switch between that and the randomly rolled perk in the inspection screen).\u00a0\n&gt;* Trials weapons:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Celerity grants a permanently active +20 to both Reload and Handling.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Celerity is now a fixed alternate perk in the right column on Adept drops of Trials weapons (i.e. you can switch between that and the randomly rolled perk in the inspection screen).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Moving forward, we're not done with origin perks, and hope to have something that better achieves our goals in a future release.\u00a0\n&gt;\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Spooky Scary Stream Team\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/150/150057/JB_S13_Exotic_Quest_07.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XmSODmW.jpg)\n\n\nNext week, we are going to be firing up the stream machine again.

When the Season began, we revealed our Seasonal calendar which showed that on March 30th the Proving Grounds strike would enter the Vanguard Strikes playlist for all players.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We failed to acknowledge on the calendar that Beyond Light and the Season Pass would be required to play the Nightfall version of Proving Grounds. All Nightfalls require ownership of their associated expansion to access, with examples for previous expansion-gated Nightfalls versus free Nightfalls below:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Free to all players**: The Arms Dealer, The Devil's Lair, The Disgraced, Exodus Crash, Fallen S.A.B.E.R, The Inverted Spire, The Insight Terminus, Lake of Shadows \u00a0\n&gt;* **Requires Forsaken**: Broodhold, The Corrupted, The Hollowed Lair, Warden of Nothing \n&gt;* **Requires Shadowkeep**: The Scarlet Keep \u00a0\n&gt;* **Requires Beyond Light**: The Glassway, Proving Grounds\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We're working with our teams to update the Season of the Chosen calendar and future calendars to better reflect this distinction.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###GUARDIAN GAMES GHOST SHELLS\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;With the launch of Patch 3.1.1, it was discovered that player\u2019s Guardian Games Ghost Shells were being replaced with other Ghost Shells, and would disappear when equipped. [This issue is now resolved](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1374782580956962816?s=20).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To address any lost currencies resulting from this issue, players will be granted a Masterworked version of each of the Rival Guardian Games Ghost Shells currently unlocked in their collections.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players with full Ghost Shell inventories will have their Shells sent to the Postmaster and should pick them up before they get pushed out by other items and are no longer available.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###FLAWLESS DUNGEON\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;With the launch of Beyond Light some changes were made to how flawless Triumphs were rewarded for dungeon completions. While previously flawless Triumphs would be awarded on an individual basis for not dying during the activity, they now award on a fireteam basis instead. This means that every member of the fireteam will need to have no deaths during the activity for the flawless Triumph to be awarded for each dungeon.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###CROSS SAVE REMINDER\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Prior to altering their Cross Save setups players should keep in mind that **Cross Save does not permanently transfer characters or account data between platforms**. In order to access your Cross Save characters on a different platform than they originate Cross Save must remain active. There is no possible way to permanently transfer account data between different platforms.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To get started with Cross Save, please [click here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###WEEKLY KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players can continuously respawn in the electric wall in Presage and become trapped.\u00a0\n&gt;* Players may become stuck under moving platforms in the Proving Grounds strike.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Wanted: Arcadian Chord bounty is no longer available from Spider.\u00a0\n&gt;* Xaras, Greed of Xivu Arath is displaying as named \u2018Fallen Walker\u2019 in Korean.\u00a0\n&gt;* Players using Wish Ender may not be able to see through walls when standing in a Warlock\u2019s rift.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://help.bungie.net/hc/articles/360054863011-Destiny-2-Year-4-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information).

Our latest efforts off-world to keep Cabal leaders from strengthening Caiatl\u2019s War Council have been fruitful, but sometimes, the danger is closer to home than you\u2019d think.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the cutscene that went live on Tuesday, we won\u2019t spoil it for you. All we\u2019ll say is that what happened will not be taken lightly.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the TWAB this week, we have a refresher on Grandmaster Nightfalls for the New Lights out there, a preview for some Stasis tuning coming next week, and results for our Festival of the Lost armor ornament vote. Let\u2019s get to it!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Grandmasters of the Universe\u00a0\n\nAre you ready for a challenge? Starting on March 16, Grandmaster Nightfalls become available.\u00a0\n\n\nNever heard of a Grandmaster Nightfall before? No problem. Let\u2019s get you up to speed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Strike difficulty is set to 1350 Power.\u00a0\n* Minimum Power required is 1325.\u00a0\n* Contest Mode is enabled, so even if you go higher than 1325, you will be capped.\u00a0\n* Each strike will have a specific set of modifiers to ramp up the difficulty, so make sure to inspect each one to know which Champions you\u2019ll face, and what other challenges await you.\u00a0\n* One Grandmaster Nightfall will be available each week until April 20\u00a0\n* Starting April 20, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to blaze through all available Grandmaster Nightfalls through a direct launch playlist.\u00a0\n* If you miss a week, the final three weeks of the Season are your opportunity to catch up!\u00a0\n\n\nThis Season will also be your first opportunity to earn Adept weapons through a PvE activity. While Shadow Price, Palindrome, and The SWARM have each been available when completing lower difficulties of Nightfalls, Adept versions will only be available through Grandmaster difficulty.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148944/S13_Strike_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/znsyayM.jpg)\n\n\nThese weapons grant additional stat bonuses when Masterworked, and can be socketed with Adept weapon mods. You can earn these mods in Trials of Osiris and you\u2019ll be able to earn them through Grandmaster Nightfalls as well.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, this will be your first opportunity to earn a Gilded version of the Conqueror title. If you see someone sporting this in a few weeks, know they went through an *ordeal*\u00a0to earn it. Well, not just one... but many.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149756/Gilded_Title_1920x1080.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ysJ00A5.jpg)\n\n\nNow\u2019s the time to form a fireteam and start strategizing how you\u2019ll work together to overcome the challenge. Smoke bombs might come in handy when things are looking dire, or a well-placed Nova Bomb to eliminate some Champions that have been stunned near each other. Word on the street is that the Cult of Aeon is rising up through the ranks, helping Guardians to keep their ammunition stocked during the fight.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to see what strategies you create in the face of challenge, and to see what sweet loot you claim from the hands of your enemies.\u00a0\n\n\nEyes up, Guardians.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patch Note Previews\u00a0\n\nOver the last few weeks, numerous teams throughout the studio have been working on bug fixes ranging from strikes to Sandbox. Our current target for Destiny 2 Update 3.1.1 is next Tuesday, March 16. While this isn\u2019t the largest patch we\u2019ve shipped, we\u2019re excited to get these fixes out in the wild.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, we made a commitment to some balance passes for Stasis in the Destiny 2021 Update: The Road to The Witch Queen. We had a few notes on how we\u2019d be tuning the Titan Behemoth, Hunter Revenant, and Warlock Shadebinder subclasses.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n###**Destiny 2 Update Preview for March 16 Patch\u00a0**\n\nStrikes:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Fallen S.A.B.E.R.:\u00a0\n\n\n   * Fixed an issue where the strike Boss would not spawn until all players were alive and present.\u00a0\n   * Improved objective waypoint behavior.\u00a0\n   * Fixed some grammatical errors in player-directive text.\u00a0\n   * Fixed a bug where a fireteam member entering the area late could cause the Warsat falling visual effects again.\u00a0\n   * Fixed an issue where Zavala's dialog in the first area could play multiple times.\u00a0\n   * Fixed a bug where a fallen energy shield could be seen sticking out of a wall.\u00a0 \u00a0\n* Devil's Lair:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n   * Sepiks Prime now has a Boss health bar.\u00a0\n   * Fixed some floating environment objects.\u00a0\n   * Fixed an issue where some monster spawn points looked like accessible doorways to players.\u00a0\n   * Fixed an issue where an Overload Captain could spawn with the wrong name.\u00a0\n   * Fixed an issue where the Fallen Walker and Fallen Brigs could respawn after they were defeated.\u00a0\n   * Fixed an issue where physics was missing from a wall early in the strike, allowing players to get lost out of environment.\u00a0\n\n\nArmor\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue with the Linear Actuators Exotic perk for the Titan Exotic Dunemarchers, which was not triggering properly. The perk now behaves as expected, triggering on each/subsequent melee strike after an appropriate amount of sprint time.\u00a0\n* Font of Might no longer displays a generic \"Damage Boost\" string when its benefit is active.\u00a0\n* Fixed a bug where the Mantle of Battle Harmony and Omnioculus Exotics were not displaying their flavor text.\u00a0\n* Omioculus also no longer grants melee energy when making only yourself invisible under some circumstances.\u00a0\n* Cuirass of the Falling Star no longer grants an Overshield when used with Supers other than Thundercrash.\u00a0\n\n\nWeapons\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where flavor text wasn't appearing for several seasonal weapons.\u00a0\n* Added rumble to the end of Dead Man's Tale's reload.\u00a0\n* Adjusted Riskrunner perk VFX that were causing epileptic issues.\u00a0\n* Reduced Arbalest's aim assist, making it harder to hit headshots in Crucible.\u00a0\n* Set the Frenzy and Cranial Spike perks to use the correct buff icons.\u00a0\n* Fixed Ticuu's Divination's missing kill feed icon.\u00a0\n* After a few weeks of development and playtests, we also have a round of Stasis balancing slated for March 23.\u00a0\n\n\n###**Stasis Tuning Preview for March 23 Patch\u00a0**\n\n\n\nBefore we dive in to the patch notes, we have a few words from the team to walk through the goals of this tuning pass:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey everyone, Gameplay Team at Bungie here. We made some targeted changes to Stasis in Season 12 and wanted to see how they landed before making any more adjustments. Now that we\u2019ve have several weeks of data to analyze, we're ready to make some further changes to address additional pain points of Stasis in PVP. Our goal with these changes is to reduce some of the frustrations when fighting against Stasis subclasses in the Crucible, while maintaining their power in PvE content wherever possible. With that said, some changes required us to adjust the global behavior of some abilities. In the patch notes below, we\u2019ve explicitly mentioned which changes will affect Crucible functionality only. We\u2019ll be closely monitoring ability performance and feedback as Season 13 continues. Thanks for playing, and we\u2019re excited to see how the future of Stasis unfolds.\n\n\n###**Hunter**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149756/2020_Beyond_Light_Stasis_Presskit_Stasis_07.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eSIVnqZ.jpg)\n\n\n* Shatterdive\u00a0\n\n\n   * Removed damage resistance from Shatterdive.\u00a0\n   * Added a 4s cooldown between activations of Shatterdive.\u00a0\n* Withering Blade\u00a0\n\n\n   * Decreased Withering Blade damage against players from 90 to 65 damage.

Movie Monsters vs Dinosaurs, or #TeamMonsters vs #TeamDinos if you were watching Twitter trends. Truth be told, we saw many more votes than anticipated. There were just over 200,000 votes cast, but a clear winner emerged. Our scientists were more preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should! All said and done, we have a clear winner.\u00a0\n\n\n###**Dinosaurs win!**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149756/dino_guardians_2.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2f8UohQ.png)\n\n*([Community art by Jarhinge](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Detail?itemId=258468638))\u00a0*\n\n\nFor all of you monster-movie lovers, do not fret! While #TeamDinos have won the day by a fairly significant margin (Ex: Titans voted #TeamDino at 81% to #TeamMonsters at 19%), there\u2019s still opportunity in the future for these sweet armor ornaments to see the light of day.\u00a0\n\n\nMany thanks to all who participated in this first stab at a community vote! This wasn\u2019t just exciting to watch unfold throughout the community conversation, but we had a great time watching the data as it built a clear story of which ornament sets would be chosen. While we won\u2019t hold votes for everything we do in Destiny, we\u2019re excited to do more of these in the future. Stay tuned!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patch Prep\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/WXluYiR.gif)\n\n\nNext week brings another update to Destiny 2, but for some Guardians in the states, you'll also be setting your clocks forward an hour. Yes, the age-old tradition of losing an hour of sleep for reasons that people can\u2019t seem to remember anymore is here once again. Alright, now that I\u2019ve gotten my complaints out of the way, let\u2019s get to the important stuff from Destiny Player Support.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n[**KNOWN ISSUES LIST**](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054863011)\u00a0\u00a0[**#HELP FORUMS**](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help)\u00a0\u00a0[**BUNGIE HELP TWITTER**](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp?s=20)\n\n\n \n**SPRINGING FORWARD\u00a0**\n\nDaylight Saving Time 2021 begins on Sunday, March 14, in the United States.

During this time, clan XP from all sources (bounties, activities, etc.) will be lost and won\u2019t count towards clan XP totals.\u00a0\n\n\nStay tuned to [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp?lang=en) on Twitter for more information.\u00a0\n\n\n**PRESAGE SCANNABLES\u00a0**\n\nIn the Presage mission, the scannables are on a weekly lockout. Players need to find and scan the first set of scannables in their entirety and complete the associated Triumph before the next set of scannables become available upon the next weekly reset.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPlayers who only partially complete the scannables for a given week will not have the next set of scannables available at the weekly reset.\u00a0\n\n\nPlayers who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\u00a0\n\n\n**TRIALS OF OSIRIS\u00a0**\n\nWe have resolved an issue that prevented the Trials of Osiris from being active the past two weekends.

I\u2019m terrified of flying. It\u2019s one of my biggest fears, even if there shouldn\u2019t be anything scary about flying through the air in a huge metal tube at ridiculous speeds. In any case, the winners this week capitalized on my fears, as they decided to go over the max weight limit of a Fallen Skiff.\u00a0\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Max Occupancy Has Been Reached\u00a0**\n\n&gt;I would love to see the pilots face \ud83e\udd23 [pic.twitter.com/fVCq3j1c9A](https://t.co/fVCq3j1c9A)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 Chrizmo (@Chrizmo__) [March 7, 2021](https://twitter.com/Chrizmo__/status/1368677804829794304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Affection\u00a0\u00a0**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/I9gMXmTEgaY)\n\n\n**Shanty of the Week: Runnin\u2019 To Europa\u00a0**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/jWGCjSW9Zug)\n\n\nAlrighty, that\u2019s it!

A few community members put on a fun art exchange, full of kickass Warlocks, beautiful images of Crow, and some other fun surprises.

Well, that last one is totally optional, but we would love to see what you\u2019re cooking up.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nHere we are. A full year of working remotely. Last year, I said that our weekly TWAB installments have been helping to keep my head focused on what day it is, but I must admit, I find myself asking what year it is more often than not. It\u2019s been March for about 12 months now, but I\u2019m happy to say that things are starting to get brighter with each passing day.\u00a0\n\n\nCheers to the fireteams that have been keeping each other company over this last year. Cheers to those who have been staying safe, supporting charities, and doing whatever they can to help their communities through these times. You continue to serve as a light for those enduring some dark times, and this world is a better place thanks to you.\u00a0\n\n\nAs we head into the weekend, I\u2019ll be spending some time with my Grandmaster fireteam figuring out what days and times we\u2019ll be hitting the activity. We earned our initial Conqueror titles in Season of Arrivals together, and I\u2019m pretty excited to go for Gild with the same group. Yeah yeah, \u201c*friendgame is the true endgame*\u201d gets meme'd on every so often, but I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t admit that this fireteam has been the sickest loot I\u2019ve ever gotten from Destiny.\u00a0\n\n\nI hope you\u2019re able to form the similar bonds through clans and friendships found in the Destiny community. They don\u2019t come often, but when they do, they can last a lifetime.\u00a0\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\ndmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 2031490, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 3/11/2021", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/m33bkj/this_week_at_bungie_3112021/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [{"award_sub_type": "PREMIUM", "award_type": "global", "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "coin_price": 75, "coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "days_of_premium": 0, "description": "For an especially amazing showing.", "end_date": null, "giver_coin_reward": 0, "icon_format": "APNG", "icon_height": 512, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/SnooClappingPremium_512.png", "icon_width": 512, "id": "award_9663243a-e77f-44cf-abc6-850ead2cd18d", "is_enabled": true, "is_new": false, "name": "Bravo Grande!", "penny_donate": 0, "penny_price": 0, "resized_icons": [{"height": 16, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/SnooClappingPremium_16.png", "width": 16}, {"height": 32, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/SnooClappingPremium_32.png", "width": 32}, {"height": 48, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/SnooClappingPremium_48.png", "width": 48}, {"height": 64, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/SnooClappingPremium_64.png", "width": 64}, {"height": 128, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/SnooClappingPremium_128.png", "width": 128}], "resized_static_icons": [{"height": 16, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/59e02tmkl4451_BravoGrande-Static.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3459bdf1d1777821a831c5bf9834f4365263fcff", "width": 16}, {"height": 32, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/59e02tmkl4451_BravoGrande-Static.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9181d68065ccfccf2b1074e499cd7c1103aa2ce8", "width": 32}, {"height": 48, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/59e02tmkl4451_BravoGrande-Static.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=339b368d395219120abc50d54fb3e2cdcad8ca4f", "width": 48}, {"height": 64, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/59e02tmkl4451_BravoGrande-Static.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de4ebbe92f9019de05aaa77f88810d44adbe1e50", "width": 64}, {"height": 128, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/59e02tmkl4451_BravoGrande-Static.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba6c1add5204ea43e5af010bd9622392a42140e3", "width": 128}], "start_date": null, "static_icon_height": 512, "static_icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_q0gj4/59e02tmkl4451_BravoGrande-Static.png", "static_icon_width": 512, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "subreddit_id": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null}, {"award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "award_type": "global", "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "coin_price": 150, "coin_reward": 0, "count": 2, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "days_of_premium": 0, "description": "Thank you stranger.

you.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWelcome to the TWAB. If this is your first time reading one of these, welcome and thank you for taking the time. We write one every week to share important info about the game, fun stuff we\u2019re doing on the side, and also highlight some cool creations from the community. We know there\u2019s a whole internet full of dance videos and cats doing funny stuff, so we appreciate all readers, new and old.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyways, let\u2019s get into it. We\u2019ve got reports that Guardians are continuing to explore the Glykon, the derelict ship at the heart of the Presage mission. And this week, they\u2019re claiming a new Ghost Shell for their efforts. We also introduced a new [Tech Blog](https://www.bungie.net/en/BungieTech/Index) earlier this week. If you want an in-depth look at the nuts and bolts that make Destiny 2 tick, [check out our write up on hunting down a hard to find bug that was affecting bounty progress.\u00a0\u00a0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50140)\n\n\nThe big buzz around the community this week has been players finding out a way to cram four fireteams in activities meant for one. We\u2019ve been watching the 12-player raid hype and are glad you\u2019re enjoying yourselves. We aren\u2019t rushing out a fix for this and it\u2019s totally fine if you want to try it out and have some fun. Just keep in mind that we didn\u2019t create these activities expecting a clown car of Guardians to roll up, so you may experience some weirdness.\u00a0\n\n\nWe are planning on fixing this before Grandmaster Nightfall's begin on March 16, but you are free to party up until the fix goes live.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##International Women\u2019s Day\u00a0\n\n\nI\u2019m going to step aside and hand it over to our Women@Bungie Inclusion Club to share some things we have planned for Women\u2019s History Month!\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Women@Bungie**: As we spring into March, we welcome Women\u2019s History Month. It is a time to commemorate and celebrate the vital role that women have played in American history. The month of March serves as a monument to the successes of women and urges us to reflect on the critical strides that have been set forth through years of action and perseverance. Our Women@Bungie Inclusion Club will use this month to educate our employees of this history and pay tribute to the incredible progressives before us whose courage and devotion paved the way for a more equitable society. We look forward to sharing more about Women@Bungie and our internal and external-facing goals with all of you in the near future!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In a few short days on March 8, we will join the world in celebrating International Women\u2019s Day, both a time for the global community to celebrate the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women, as well as a call to action to accelerate women\u2019s equality around the world.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s in the spirit of this action that we are excited to announce the newest addition to our Diversity and Inclusion pin series, [available for pre order now](https://bungiestore.com/products/preorder-international-womens-day-collectible-pin). As with our previous pins, you will also receive a new emblem to show off to your friends in orbit. Emblem codes for preordering will be sent out sometime later this month.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149698/WHM_Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oJa42jF.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;100% of profits from purchases of this pin will be donated to organizations dedicated to combatting the patterns of historic discrimination, harassment, and abuse of women as well as to helping women pursue careers in the gaming and tech industry. During the month of March, all profits will be donated to [AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org/).\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Nothing Personal Kid\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve heard feedback that enemies are a bit more \u201cteleporty\u201d since the launch of Beyond Light \u2013 especially now in activities like Battlegrounds and Gambit. We\u2019ve noticed this happening as well and have been investigating.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are several reasons why AI can teleport in Destiny, for example, we would rather teleport a boss that is stuck behind a door than have a player be unable to finish a mission. However, we believe that most of the recent uptick has been caused by new issues with some of our networking logic.\u00a0\n\n\nYou may remember a [TWAB from last September](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49596) where we mentioned some under-the-hood changes we would be making in the 3.0.0 update and how we expected there might be bugs and side effects. One of the big changes we made is that previously we had two \u201cstreams\u201d of network traffic: One for gameplay simulation stuff like AI, and another for handling activity stuff like playing music, showing mission objectives, playing dialogue, etc. With update 3.0.0 we combined this traffic into a single stream.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThink of it as having two highways for different types of cars, and then one day you close one highway and plan to have one wider highway to handle all the cars. Unfortunately, we underestimated how much additional traffic there would be, and we need to do some additional work here to add lanes.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother thing adding to the traffic are the tons of Cabal enemies wielding flamethrowers in Season of the Chosen \u2013 especially in Battlegrounds. Continuing with the highway analogy, flamethrowers are like tanker trucks. They\u2019re notoriously taxing and in this case are creating a lot of network usage. We have some improvements to their efficiency that should help, in an update scheduled for later this month.\u00a0\n\n\nAs many of you have noticed, we created encounters chock-full of enemies in Season of the Chosen. We\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s super fun to take on large amounts of enemies, but spawning all of this AI quickly, especially in some of the Battlegrounds, may also be contributing to the teleporting issues as networking pipelines try to handle the load. Spawning enemies rapidly is like a big sporting event driving up traffic.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019re working on improvements for how we handle network traffic and think it will reduce the amount of teleporting.\u00a0 Of course we\u2019ll never completely eliminate it, because player-facing teleporting can be caused by internet hiccups, but we hope to significantly reduce the frequency. We\u2019re also looking at some targeted content fixes where enemies are spawned into a bad place and teleport because of issues with their pathing.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Deep Stone Deep Dives\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149698/DSC-Feature-Header_997x500.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OQxJkj5.jpg)\n\n\nYesterday, we fired up the streaming gear and showcased the Deep Stone Crypt raid. It was a great time as our developers provided commentary and behind-the-scenes insight while our fireteam battled through the boss fights.\u00a0\n\n\nDid you miss it? It\u2019s OK. We saved you a link. [Watch the whole thing here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/935543283?t=0h14m47s ).\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s not all. If you already watched the stream and want more, we [published an article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50141) with interviews with the devs and an even deeper dive into the [Deep Stony Crypt](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1367194221082333185) covering a few things we didn\u2019t mention during the stream.\u00a0\n\n\n[\u00a0Go give it a read!](https://bung.ie/2OhUCuQ)\u00a0\n\n\nThis was fun to put together and we hope you enjoyed it. Let us know how what you think and if you would like to see more of these in the future.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Don\u2019t BOO... Vote\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re rapidly approaching spring but are already planning for Festival of the Lost later this year. We\u2019re excited to share previews of two concepts we have for Eververse which can be purchased for Silver or earned via Bright Dust. Check them out!\u00a0\n\n\nMovie Monsters VS Dinosaurs! Two larger-than-life legends battle for control over this year\u2019s Festival of the Lost. The universe isn\u2019t big enough for both of them and they have only one goal: Winning your vote.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNow you might be thinking, \u201cHey, that dinosaur has some pretty good policy ideas.\u201d But maybe the Movie Monster charging towards you as you fill out your ballot is making you nervous. We get it, it\u2019s a high-pressure situation. Now choose!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNo matter who wins, there will be candy.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149698/classic_giant_monsters.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FHgWYyj.jpg)\n\n\n###VS\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149698/dino_guardians.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/v7EJzjf.jpg)\n\n\nBoth are awesome and we\u2019re having a tough time choosing which one to use this year. We decided to give the community an opportunity to pick which set they like best!\u00a0\n\n\n[To vote just visit this link and fill out the brief survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/fotlsurvey). It\u2019s that easy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDeadline for voting is 3/08/2021 at 6 PM PST. We will announce the winner in a future TWAB.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Prime Gaming\n\nLast week, we added new rewards that are available through Prime Gaming.

Players should be aware that this Triumph will not reward retroactively, and they will need to re-earn the Triumph for it to register on their account.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###FROZEN IN TIME ORNAMENT\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We're currently investigating an issue where owners of the Beyond Light Digital Deluxe Edition can't equip their Frozen in Time ornament for the No Time to Explain Exotic Pulse Rifle.

This Quest Archive will hold any abandoned, lost, or uncompleted quests that are not in a player\u2019s inventory. If a quest appears to be missing from the inventory, players are advised to visit the Quest Archive near the Postmaster in the Tower to see if the quest is available there.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054863011-Destiny-2-Year-4-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Cabal Gold does not drop from raid or dungeon completions.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Swapping between Challenger Medallions or Cabal Runes on the Hammer of Proving does not refund currencies used.\u00a0\n&gt;* The region chest in Watcher's Grave on Nessus is not appearing for players as intended.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Some Crucible gold medals are no longer being recorded on emblem trackers.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054863011-Destiny-2-Year-4-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information).

Presage.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore we go about our weekly TWAB programming, we have some required reading! Well, maybe required isn\u2019t the correct word, but you are definitely going to want to read the news that was delivered earlier today about the state of the game and our plans for the future, provided by Assistant Destiny 2 Game Director Joe Blackburn.\u00a0\n\n###[State of Destiny 2021 \u2013 The Road to The Witch Queen\u00a0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50124%22%20/)\n\nWe aren\u2019t going to provide a TL;DR, as we want you to go read this thing, but I would like to provide a quick list of topics covered:\n\n\n\n* News about The Witch Queen\u2019s release date, Lightfall, and beyond.\u00a0\n* Power, and how it raises Season over Season.\u00a0\n* No additional Infusion Caps.\u00a0\n* PvP: Our goals for the future of Crucible, Stasis balancing, game security, and Trials of Osiris\u00a0\n* Information about Vault of Glass.\u00a0\n* The new transmog system we\u2019re calling Armor Synthesis.\u00a0\n* And more!\u00a0\n\n\nNow, we leave it to you to read the article! Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll still be here when you get back.\u00a0\n\n\n...have you read it yet? Yeeees? Good. We hope that you\u2019re just as excited for the future of Destiny 2 as we are. Now, let\u2019s shift our focus to the live game.\u00a0\n\n\nThis week has been a fun ride so far! Saladin is not only hosting Iron Banner but has sent Guardians back to Nessus to fight through a fourth Battleground. With approval from the Vanguard, we\u2019ve also been seeing many Guardians venturing back into the Presage mission, uncovering new lore, and finding a sweet new catalyst for Dead Man\u2019s Tale (for those of you who like to shoot from the hip).\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/E4tJxUxSTdY)\n\n\nMaster difficulty can prove challenging, but with the right fireteam, you can absolutely find success. As you venture through this derelict ship, be sure to watch out for scannable objects. They may prove valuable to you on your journey to uncover more knowledge.\u00a0\n\n\nThe TWAB this week will be looking at a few feedback items concerning Ritual playlist rewards, an update on DDoS protection for consoles, and an announcement of our upcoming Deep Stone Crypt developer deep dive. Read on for more.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Diving Deeper into the Deep Stone Crypt\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149568/DSC_Livestream_Asset.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cmvfGBW.jpg)\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since our last stream, hasn\u2019t it? One of our favorite things to do is bridge the gap between player and developer, giving a peek behind the proverbial curtain of Destiny 2 development. In the past, we\u2019ve offered deep dives on raids, dungeons, secret missions, and more! This time, we\u2019re heading back to the Deep Stone Crypt. As our brave fireteam ventures through the frozen wastes of Europa and polished halls of BrayTech Research labs, developers will be providing commentary on how the secret sauce was made. You won\u2019t want to miss this!\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Deep Stone Crypt Developer Deep Dive\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;**Wednesday, March 3\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;**10 AM PST\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;**[Twitch.tv/Bungie](https://www.twitch.tv/bungie) and [Youtube.com/Bungie](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bungie)\u00a0**\n\n\nWe\u2019ll have representatives from various disciplines of development including design, art, VFX, narrative, and more! We\u2019re excited to dust off the stream equipment and hope to see you there.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Ritual Playlist Weapon Rewards\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve been sinking a lot of time into Gambit searching for a Bottom Dollar Hand Cannon over the last two weeks. It\u2019s beautiful, lives in the 120 RPM archetype, and can be found when completing Gambit matches. Today, we\u2019ve invited **Weapons Feature Lead Chris Proctor** to walk us through freshly introduced ritual playlist rewards, where to get them, and some plans to address feedback on drop rates.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Chris:** At the release of Beyond Light, we introduced new weapons into the reward pools of Crucible, Gambit, and Vanguard Strikes. To give a quick rundown for the New Lights out there, each of these weapons has a low drop rate and deep perk pools, intended to give players dedicated to a particular playlist a weapon to hunt. Our goal when introducing these rewards was to provide space for longer term, ritual-specific goals for players as they chase after the perfect roll on a given weapon, and explore the possibility space of perk rolls on a weapon archetype in the same way weapon designers do.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149568/S12_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UoZdLUR.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;*Pictured: Vanguard Shotgun, Crucible Pulse Rifle, Gambit Grenade Launcher\u00a0*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As we saw some positive reception to these weapons in Beyond Light, with players digging through the perks and comparing rolls, we\u2019ve added two more to each ritual in Season of the Chosen, bringing the total per ritual to three.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149568/S13_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KknwHBy.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;*Pictured: Vanguard Pulse Rifle/Rocket Launcher, Crucible Sniper Rifle/Sidearm, Gambit Hand Cannon/Fusion Rifle\u00a0*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While the drop rates for each individual weapon are not intended to be so high that it\u2019s easy to quickly acquire a large amount of rolls, we\u2019ve been seeing some feedback that they currently feel too scarce. Our current plan is to increase drop chances for these ritual-specific weapons later in Season of the Chosen. While we don\u2019t want these weapons to become a short-term grind for players seeking perfect rolls, we do believe that they need to drop a bit more frequently for them to be a positive experience when completing their associated activities. Once these drop changes are live, we\u2019ll be watching the conversation to see if any other changes need to be made.\u00a0\n\n\nOur current plan is to continue adding weapons to these pools in future Seasons. There may be some Seasons where these pools remain the same, and others where a new weapon is added while one is rotated out. This should help keep the offerings streamlined for players on the hunt for a specific reward.\u00a0\n\n\nThank you to all who\u2019ve been sounding off with feedback since these were introduced, and we\u2019re excited to hear more!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Console SDR \u2013 Status Update\u00a0\n\nPrior to the release of Season of the Chosen, we announced that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection would be coming to consoles during Season of the Chosen, bringing protections for your network connection against DDoS and IP harvesting attacks via usage of the Steam Datagram Relay (SDR) service. As our Seasonal content went online, we uncovered a few general bugs and crashes which needed to be addressed before we could start bringing this feature forward.\u00a0\n\n\nAs these issues have now been mitigated, our teams have started to bring console SDR services online. This will be a multi-week initiative, as we want to ensure service stability across all platforms while weeding out any bugs or increases in error codes. If any major issues are found during this process, it may take more time for us to bring this fully online, but we\u2019ll be sure to announce when our work is done.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf you begin to encounter any error codes or crashes when playing Destiny 2, please report them to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help) right here on Bungie.net.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Battleground Throwdown\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rQzHew8.gif)\n\nSeason of the Chosen has been a wild ride for our support teams. We've shipped multiple hotfixes, have another on the way, and we're not even halfway through the season yet. While we've squashed many bugs along the way, we still have more to catch. Our Player Support team has a quick update on what we're tracking, what we're about to fix, and a quick not about our transition to a new Help Center!\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n[**KNOWN ISSUES LIST**](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054863011)\u00a0\u00a0[**#HELP FORUMS**](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help)\u00a0\u00a0[**BUNGIE HELP TWITTER**](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp?s=20)\n\n\n \n**HOTFIX 3.1.0.2\u00a0**\n\n\nNext Tuesday, March 2, Hotfix 3.1.0.2 will be released. Here is a timeline of events:\u00a0\n\n\n* March 2, 8 AM PST (1600 UTC): Destiny 2 maintenance for Hotfix 3.1.0.2 begins.\u00a0\n* March 2, 8:45 AM PST (1645 UTC): Players are removed from activities and won't be able to log back into Destiny 2 until 9 AM PST when Hotfix 3.1.0.2 is available.\u00a0\u00a0\n* March 2, 9 AM PST (1700 UTC): Destiny 2 Hotfix 3.1.0.2 is rolled out across all platforms and regions. Players can log back into Destiny 2 at this time. Ongoing maintenance is expected to conclude at 10 AM PST.\u00a0 \u00a0\n* March 2, 10 AM PST (1800 UTC): Destiny 2 maintenance is expected to conclude.\u00a0\n\n\nBelow are some issues that will be resolved with Hotfix 3.1.0.2. A complete list will be shared when the update goes live.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Barrier Colossus** in Battleground: Behemoth will no longer mosey out of their barrier shields to say hello to unsuspecting Guardians.\u00a0\n* The **Chosen Destruction Umbral Focusing Lens** will now allow players to focus Umbral Engrams.\u00a0\n* **Beneficial modifiers** in the Battlegrounds playlist now work as intended.\u00a0\n\n\n**PRESAGE COMPLETIONS\u00a0**\n\n\nTo ensure progress is recorded for \u201cThe Voice on the Other Side\u201d quest for Dead Man\u2019s Tale, players should make sure that they have the quest in their inventory prior to starting Presage. If the quest was originally acquired on another character, players will need to reacquire the quest on their current character from the Quest Archive at the Tower.\u00a0\n\n\nUpon completing Presage, players will need to pick up Dead Man\u2019s Tale and wait for the mission complete end timer to appear prior to returning to orbit. Failing to pick up the weapon or leaving before the mission completes will result in progress not being recorded for the quest.\u00a0\n\n\n**MISLABELLED EXOTIC ORNAMENTS\u00a0**\n\n\nEarlier this week, a refund was sent out to players affected by the mislabeled Exotic ornaments in Eververse. Players who qualified for the refund received a message on login and had the Silver from their ornament purchase added back to their account.\u00a0\n\n\nWe are continuing to investigate the issue causing some players to not receive their Bright Dust rewards from completing the Weekly Challenges for Gambit, Crucible, and Vanguard. Players affected by this issue will be granted the Bright Dust they should have earned in a future update.\u00a0\n\n\n**HELP CENTER MIGRATION\u00a0**\n\n\nLast week, the Help Center at [help.bungie.net](https://help.bungie.net/) completed its migration to a new service. Players who encounter broken links, untranslated sections (excluding Contact Forms), or other issues with the new Help Center should report them to our [#Companion Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=CompanionApp).\u00a0\n\n\n**COMPANION APP KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0**\n\n\nPlayers can now stay up to date on current Destiny Companion App known issues on our new [#Companion Forum Known Issues List](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/258390273). Players who encounter issues not already on the Known Issues List are encouraged to report them to our [#Companion Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=CompanionApp).\u00a0\n\n\n**KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0**\n\n\nWhile we continue investigating various [known issues](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054863011-Destiny-2-Year-4-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\n\n\n* The Trash the Thresher Triumph is not properly recording destroyed Threshers in The Arms Dealer Nightfall: The Ordeal.\u00a0\n* The Scanner and Operator augments in the Deep Stone Crypt are the same color in Tritanopia colorblind mode.\u00a0\n* Trying to equip the Mindvault ornament for Insurmountable Skullfort may result in a \u201cRequires Mod Item\u201d error.\u00a0\n* The portal to the Ascendant Realm in The Corrupted strike after the Ogre encounter may close if a player is too far ahead of the rest of their fireteam.\u00a0\n* The door to the Spider Tank encounter of the Hollowed Lair strike may not open for players.\u00a0\n* The Lost Sector puzzles for the Xenophage Exotic quest may not correctly record player inputs.\u00a0\n* Players may earn the \u201cI Am Invincible\u201d medal when the opposing team actually completed the requirements.\u00a0\n* Players who complete the Xenology quest from Xur while already having an Exotic Cipher in their inventory will have the quest removed with no reward.\u00a0\n* There are no Champions in the Master Presage mission because Scorn Champions don\u2019t exist.\u00a0\n* Players who kill the boss in the Fallen S.A.B.E.R. strike and then die may see a \u201cDarkness\u201d screen and will respawn at the beginning of the strike, which can\u2019t be restarted.\u00a0\n* As a result of this, players can load into that blocked state and be unable to progress through the strike. This issue is also occurring in the Hallowed Lair strike.\u00a0\n\n\nFor a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360054863011-Destiny-2-Year-4-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information).

You not only remember the lines, but the way you felt as you watched the action unfold on screen. Our recent Presage mission brought some great horror vibes to Destiny 2, and this week\u2019s winner embraces that while giving their take on an unsuspecting Guardian.\u00a0\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Follow the Signal (Spoiler alert for those who haven't played Presage yet!)**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/U-VheYb0cco)\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: First Sounds From Mars**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/flX_aVGnyio)\n\n\nCheers to the winners this week! If you\u2019d like to throw your movie in for consideration, make sure to submit it to the [Community Creations](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) page on Bungie.net. Please credit appropriate creators in the description of your video with links to the bungie.net profiles so we know who to grant emblems to!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Inspiration\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/145/145100/TWAB_ArtistOfTheWeek_2020_Animated_V2.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/QpLa6Gn.gif)\n\n\nAnother good thing about atmosphere is inspiration. When reading through lore books, you might begin to feel some of that inspiration when diving through the darkness, or the feelings a Guardian might have sitting in a specific seat at a local ramen shop. The featured artists this week captivate those feelings perfectly in their pieces.\u00a0\n\n\n**Art of the Week: Lore Inspires Creativity\u00a0**\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thank you for the lore that inspires creativity![#Destiny2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Destiny2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#Destiny](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Destiny?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@DestinyTheGame](https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@BNG_Ivan](https://twitter.com/BNG_Ivan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@A_dmg04](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@DestinyComArt](https://twitter.com/DestinyComArt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/clDJhRyTV0](https://t.co/clDJhRyTV0)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 ZIMOSLAVA (@Zimoslava) [February 20, 2021](https://twitter.com/Zimoslava/status/1363136100466843651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n\n**Art of the Week: Ramen\u00a0**\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I saw a lone guardian, chilling at the ramen shop, where Cayde used to sit.

We\u2019re always excited to see your content, and celebrate it with the overall community.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nAnother TWAB in the books. The fires of Iron Banner are raging, and it\u2019s about time I start hunting for a sweet new role on the Time-Worn Spire. I\u2019m starting to focus on the Pinnacle band of my Power Level, so the weekly bounty rewards are giving me a great start towards that final cap.\u00a0\n\n\nSee you out there.\u00a0\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\ndmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 2024712, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 2/25/2021", "total_awards_received": 4, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/lsi5xr/this_week_at_bungie_2252021/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613686143, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/lmyqsq/this_week_at_bungie_2182021/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lmyqsq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_css_class": "bungie", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Bungie"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2f13ba30-3d46-11e9-8cd7-0e03d8e4b5da", "link_flair_text": "Bungie", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 624, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/lmyqsq/this_week_at_bungie_2182021/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Zp51g0PwPUBMhGtpd-OG7yhnwOOc1nTdzCt9mYQLKLU", "resolutions": [{"height": 30, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GOzaIMmM8iHjBmPAY_GO6CJMrBiInzwlnwEEM8W0DKg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98d1d2b3881cbf563282d5a648f88641f7342a6", "width": 108}, {"height": 60, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GOzaIMmM8iHjBmPAY_GO6CJMrBiInzwlnwEEM8W0DKg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cbdca872d83225d4f116d96f9d18f24a65ba9bb", "width": 216}, {"height": 90, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GOzaIMmM8iHjBmPAY_GO6CJMrBiInzwlnwEEM8W0DKg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c19b7553e08a80174ed510edf7fbf06414e7a52", "width": 320}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GOzaIMmM8iHjBmPAY_GO6CJMrBiInzwlnwEEM8W0DKg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef94ad906fd704cf6cf03acfd23a00d49e234828", "width": 640}, {"height": 270, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GOzaIMmM8iHjBmPAY_GO6CJMrBiInzwlnwEEM8W0DKg.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7bcb06a7a27b182816849da74ebccdb88456710", "width": 960}, {"height": 303, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GOzaIMmM8iHjBmPAY_GO6CJMrBiInzwlnwEEM8W0DKg.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ebce0d74890c296f0ff2873ca8478e3f3873267", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/GOzaIMmM8iHjBmPAY_GO6CJMrBiInzwlnwEEM8W0DKg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=198f5ecca844aaf00aab5396d50105c4e66dc29f", "width": 1920}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1613686154, "score": 1, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50114\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we intercepted a distress signal.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nStrange things are afoot. Guardians have discovered a distress signal and Commander Zavala has ordered that the source be investigated. A mysterious derelict ship lurks in the abyss of space. Terrifying sounds of the unknown ring from within. What puzzles and treasures await?

We are hearing good things about Palindrome which was a popular Hand Cannon from the Destiny 1 era.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s not all that went live this week. A new Battleground has opened on the Cosmodrome with more huge engagements that will pit heavily outnumbered fireteams up against large waves of enemies who have entrenched themselves in defensive positions. Don\u2019t forget to pick up a few of those Cosmodrome bounties before you start taking out the Cabal, one by one.\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Iron Banner\n\nNext week, Lord Saladin will return to the Tower for the first time in Season of the Chosen. He brings with him Iron Banner bounties that will grant you pinnacle drops. This Season will have The Time-Worn Spire and Multimach CCX returning from the first year of Destiny 2 with random rolls for the first time.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149392/S13_IronBanner_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XL7dSNI.jpg)\n\n\nThere will also be a new perk called Iron Reach that can roll on these two weapons. Iron Reach will massively increase range with the tradeoff of decreased stability. Try it out and let us know what you think!\u00a0\n\n\nThe Iron Will armor set also returns, updated to accept new Combat Style mods.\u00a0\n\n\nEquip your most powerful gear and ready your favorite weapons. And remember, capture those zones.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Iron Banner and bonus Valor begins at 9 AM on February 23, running through 9 AM on March 2.\u00a0**\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##PSR IS HAUNTED (IN SPACE)\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/5dE3ckp.gif)\n\n\nIt\u2019s time now to turn things over to the experts on our Player Support Team who are tracking any known issues and when their fixes are going live.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###PRESAGE PINNACLE\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;We are currently investigating an issue causing the Pinnacle reward for Presage to drop as a Powerful reward instead.

We\u2019re glad to see you are enjoying Season of the Chosen so far, and there's definitely more coming.

Caiatl, Empress of the Cabal, has entered the fray. Zavala stood his ground when being offered a seat on her war council. Ever since, we\u2019ve been watching countless Guardians doing their best in the new Battlegrounds activity to keep the Cabal from uniting into an unstoppable threat to the system. New Seasonal Challenges have made their appearance, the [H.E.L.M. has opened its doors](https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/09/at-the-h-e-l-m-inside-new-features-coming-to-destiny-with-season-of-the-chosen/), and a fresh collection of loot has been introduced, fueling your hunt for new tools of destruction. We\u2019re just getting started. Week-1 of a new Season is always fun, but there's more coming. Stay tuned!\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148944/ae_season13_cal_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yOBH1e0.jpg)\n\n\nFor those who\u2019ve purchased Beyond Light, you may notice a few new goodies as well. The Stranger has a collection of new Stasis Aspects and Fragments to earn, giving you more combat options to choose from. A new landing zone has been added to the northern reaches of Europa to help you complete quests a bit quicker and new Exotic armor pieces have been added (one per class) for you to discover.\u00a0\n\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t purchased Beyond Light just yet, we\u2019ve also updated power floors and caps to help you get caught up for Raids, Dungeons, and general Quests! If you\u2019re looking to spend some time in our ritual activities (Strikes, Crucible, Gambit), we\u2019ve added some new weapons for you to hunt from post-game drops. Word on the street is that Bottom Dollar is a pretty spicy 120 RPM handcannon, currently available from Gambit. We\u2019re excited to see what new loot you claim as you start digging in to the new season.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s turn our eyes to the rest of the TWAB, shall we? We have a collection of patch notes that we\u2019re eager to cover, an update from Black@Bungie, and a Player Support Report walking us through known issues from Season of the Chosen.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Be Heard\u00a0\n\nOver this last year, we\u2019ve been increasing our efforts to support diversity and inclusion, not only at Bungie, but throughout the Destiny community and the gaming industry. Uplifting voices that deserve to be heard, supporting initiatives like Black Lives Matter, and forming internal clubs and committees to further support employees at Bungie looking to make a difference. These conversations should never be \u201cone and done,\u201d and we\u2019re committed to the continued support of equal justice for all.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149298/Black-at-Bungie_Blog-Header_1920x590.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/WTL18NA.jpg)\n\n\nBlack@Bungie, [introduced last year](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49718), has an update for you all on our Be Heard Collectible Pin in celebration of Black History Month.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey all!\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In August we talked about our newest addition to Bungie, Black@Bungie, with the goals of spreading equity among our employees at Bungie. With Black History month underway, Black@Bungie has been educating employees at Bungie about historical figures, current industry leaders, where to support local Black owned companies here in the Greater Seattle area, and taking our lessons and turning them into action.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;2020 was a stark reminder of the systemic racism that continues to plague the United States. We are proud and grateful for the powerful ways that many of you showed up for our Black and Brown communities through your activism, willingness to engage in challenging conversations, and support of the philanthropic work being done to combat racial injustice in our society. 100% of profits from your purchases of the Be Heard Collectible Pin last year were donated to the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), which added up to an impressive $425,000!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;These funds will help support the EJI\u2019s critical work over the next year. EJI is focusing on educating the public about America\u2019s history of racial injustice as a starting point for repairing its painful legacy of slavery, racial terror, lynching, segregation, and mass incarceration. EJI will continue to change our criminal justice system by fighting against the death penalty, challenging excessive punishment of children placed in adult prisons, and working to overturn wrongful convictions. EJI also will advocate on behalf of incarcerated men and women facing overcrowded, violent, and inhumane prison conditions. This work has become even more critical given the increased COVID-19 exposure and fatality risk inmates experience.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There is much work to be done. Thank you for continuing to support the mission of social justice for all through the purchase of the Be Heard Collectible Pin on [Bungie Store](https://bungiestore.com/products/preorder-be-heard-collectible-pin) and [EU Store](https://eu.bungiestore.com/collections/frontpage/products/preorder-be-heard-collectible-pin). 100% of profits from your purchases of the Be Heard Collectible Pin will continue to be donated to combat systemic racism. Every purchase will receive the Be Heard Destiny 2 emblem.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We at Bungie know that racial equity in America cannot be obtained by recognizing one month out of the year. We are dedicated to diversity and inclusion year-round and expect to hear more in the upcoming months about our plans. Thank you all for making Destiny a place where everyone is welcome.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patch Note Stragglers\u00a0\n\nTruth be told, it can sometimes be difficult coordinating with multiple teams to ensure every bug fix, minor tweak, or major feature is covered in a patch notes document. This Season, we identified a handful of notes that we wanted to highlight, as we feel they\u2019re pretty important changes to the Destiny 2 experience! First up, we have an introduction to Quest Details from the Dev team, followed by a general list of patch notes.\u00a0\n\n\n**Quest Details**\n\nOver the past year, we've made a handful of iterative improvements to the player\u2019s quest experience. Early on, these improvements focused on helping players understand their quests when viewed together.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMost recently, we've added the Quest Details screen. This new screen allows you to dive into the details of each quest, which should help you:\u00a0\n\n\n* Take in the narrative context and visual themes of the quest.\u00a0\n* Understand what the quest is asking you to do, and what you've done already.\u00a0\n* Get a better look at the rewards for completing the quest.\u00a0\n\n\nTaken together, we're hoping you feel more knowledgeable and motivated about the quests in your log. You can access the following screen by hovering your cursor over a given quest and using the Inspect command.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149298/Quest_Hawkmoon_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/znKfpbk.png)\n\n\nWe're excited to build on the Quest Detail screen in future updates with more improvements to the quest experience.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd now, onto some general patch notes:\u00a0\n\n\n**Rituals\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Removed Hawthorne\u2019s Red War-era dialog when completing her Clan challenge.\u00a0\n* Players can now turn in Gunsmith materials 100 at a time, and Vanguard tokens 20 at a time \u2013 enough to get a full rank.\u00a0\n\n\n**Reputation\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Valor, Glory, and Infamy rank-up banners are now at the bottom of the screen, no longer blocking players from taking actions in orbit when hitting a new rank.\u00a0\n* Valor, Glory, and Infamy values are now available on the main Director screen for the ritual.\u00a0\n\n\n**Gambit\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Reworked the mote system for more reliable gathering.\u00a0\n\n\n**Crucible\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Iron Banner\u00a0\n\n\n   * Removed Skill Based Matchmaking listing from the Iron Banner tooltip \u2013 it has been using Connection-Based Matchmaking, along with the rest of the Crucible, since June of 2020.\u00a0\n* Survival\u00a0\n\n\n   * Life count changed from 6 to 4, respawn time changed from 7s to 5s, consistent with ruleset prior to Beyond Light.\u00a0\n\n\n**New Light\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* A Guardian Rises\u00a0\n\n\n   * Destroying the Spider Tank during The Divide phase will now progress the directive by 50%.\u00a0\n   * Fixed an issue where veteran accounts that start a new character could not be progress or dismiss some tutorials.\u00a0\n* Schism\u00a0\n\n\n   * Fixed an issue where players could jump through a window during the Navota vignette and block their mission progress.\u00a0\n* Cold Boot\u00a0\n\n\n   * Fixed an issue for veteran characters playing the New Light quest that would cause the Legendary weapon tutorial to persist through the entire mission.\u00a0\n\n\n**Risk/Reward (Riskrunner)\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where players with full Energy weapon inventory slots would have Riskrunner sent to the Postmaster upon pick up.\u00a0\n* The weapon now drops as an Exotic Engram during the mission, allowing players to clear room in their inventories if they wish to pick up their Riskrunner immediately.\u00a0\n\n\n**Forsaken Campaign\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where players would see a \"Quests Full\" message when trying to start the Forsaken campaign, forcing them to find and pick up the quest at the Quest Archive in the Tower before proceeding.\u00a0\n\n\nAll missing patch notes are being added to the [Destiny 2 Update 3.1.0 article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50097). If you haven\u2019t taken a look at everything that\u2019s changed this Season, stop by and give it a read!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Destiny Content Vault + Cosmodrome\u00a0\n\nThis season, two strikes from Destiny 1 are making their entrance to Destiny 2 through the Destiny Content Vault. We have a quick update on our plans for the Cosmodrome from the Development Team.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev Team:\u00a0**Last summer, when we revealed our plans for the [Destiny Content Vault](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49189) \u2013 where we cycle out older underused content to improve our ability to evolve Destiny 2 \u2013 we also committed to periodically unvaulting legacy content, merging some of the best that Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 has to offer. That announcement included the reveal that the Cosmodrome would be returning, and that it would be \u2018fleshed out to roughly Destiny 1 Year-1 parity.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When we first shared our plans, we were still early in development and uncertain how far we would go with the Cosmodrome unvault. We were pretty sure it wouldn\u2019t include the Plaguelands but what about the locations added in the Year-1 DLCs, or the awesome Colony Ship behind Sepik\u2019s Lair with The Taken King? What about all of the public patrol spaces? How much of Cosmo would we need in order to accomplish our goals of having a great space to tell the new Guardian origin story while still giving veteran players a big dose of nostalgia via some updates to the strike playlist?\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As we approached Beyond Light\u2019s launch, it became clear to us that we had a choice to make: After returning all three of its original strikes, do we invest more time and resources in bringing Cosmodrome to D1 parity or do we switch our focus to building new experiences for Year 4 and beyond? Given that we believed we had achieved our original goals and knowing the community and team\u2019s desire for new content, we chose the latter option. But, when we made that decision, we failed to properly update your expectations for how far the Cosmodrome experience was going to be extended and that was a mistake. So, to clear things up: With the Devil\u2019s Lair and Fallen S.A.B.E.R. strikes returning, we don\u2019t have any active plans to add more to the Cosmodrome than what is there will be focusing on new updates overall.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We will continue to use the Destiny Content Vault to drive variety in the live game in the future. The Cosmodrome was our first big push and later this year the Vault of Glass will return.\u00a0We\u2019ll share more later this year.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Chosen Ones\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CS7b5W1.gif)\n\n\nWe never want to jinx a new Season by saying \u201cthings are looking good!\u201d - so let\u2019s avoid that. Earlier this week, we issued a hotfix to address some crashing issues on Steam, and we have a handful of new issues being tracked with Season of the Chosen content. Destiny Player Support has a full writeup on known issues, workarounds, and fresh investigations below.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**UPDATE 3.1.0.1\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0Next Thursday, February 18, Hotfix 3.1.0.1 will be released.

A complete list will be shared when the update goes live.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* **Salvager\u2019s Salvo** can now be reclaimed from Collections.\u00a0\n* Vendor tooltips will no longer say they require **Trials Tokens** to rank up reputation.\u00a0\n* **The Whisper of Chains Stasis Fragment** will now properly grant damage resistance when standing near frozen enemies.\u00a0\n* Swapping between **Challenger Medallions** or **Cabal Runes** on the Hammer of Proving will now refund currencies used.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**STEAM LAUNCH ISSUES\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We are currently investigating reports of players being unable to launch Destiny 2 from Steam, and will provide more information as it becomes available. Players who are affected by this issue should report to our #Help Forum.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**BEYOND LIGHT AND SEASON PASS CLARIFICATION**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nPlayers should be aware that the \u201cBeyond Light+Season\u201d\nbundle and the \u201cDestiny 2 Legendary Edition\u201d include a single Season Pass that\nwill be applied to their account upon purchase. These bundles do not include\nmore than one Season Pass.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* **Cabal Gold** is not dropping from raid or dungeon completions.\u00a0\n* Socketing the Hammer of Proving prior to receiving a quest step to do so will not complete the step; **players will need to re-socket the Hammer to progress**.\u00a0\u00a0\n* **Barrier Colossus Champions** in Battleground: Behemoth may walk out of their Barrier shields.\u00a0\n* **Ascendant Shards** from Crucible and Gambit rank rewards cannot be acquired with a full consumables inventory, even if there is room in an Ascendant Shard stack.\u00a0\n* The back half of the **Bump and Run** Sparrow is missing.\u00a0\n* **Warlock Lucent Night Universal Armor Ornaments** disappear from the Appearance tab of armor when unequipped.\u00a0\n* **Dunemarchers** Linear Actuators perk no longer activates.\u00a0\n* Multiple **armor mods**, including **Handcannon targetting**, are missing from player inventories.\u00a0\n* The **Fourteenth Anamnesis ornament** shows that it can be applied to Khepri's Sting instead of the Helm of Saint-14.\u00a0\n* The **Mantle of Remembrance ornament** shows that it can be applied to Aeon Swift, but it's actually for Shinobu's Vow.\u00a0\n* **Step two of the Decrypting Darkness quest will not grant a free Umbral Engram** when being completed on a second character. This is intentional, and players will need to play activities to find another Umbral Engram or acquire one from their Season Pass.\u00a0\n* We are investigating an increase in **ANTEATER** error codes.\u00a0\n* The Vanguard 8-bounty challenge sometimes does not award **Bright Dust** on completion.\u00a0\n* The **Caduceus** ornament shows that it can be applied to Aeon Soul, but it's actually for Ophidian Aspect.\u00a0\n* **Eyes of Tomorrow** is doing less damage than intended.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

The fan art has been awesome, and we have to say that your attention to detail is unparalleled!\u00a0\n\n\n**Art of the Week: Bow\u00a0**\n\n\n&gt;BOW\u2019 \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Quick 1 hr sketch of the new season\u2019s big bad, Caiatl. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Happy Chosen day, Guardians!

Truth be told, we check quite a few hashtags when looking for pieces to be featured. #DestinyArt, #Destiny, #HeyBungieLookAtThisCoolArt... they're all acceptable. In any case, cheers to all who spend their time creating sweet art based on the Destiny universe. We always love seeing and sharing these.\n\n\n***\n\n\nWith everything going on, it\u2019s been hard keeping track of the days this week. Depending on your time zone (and when you\u2019re reading this), today is Thursday, which means tomorrow is Friday... I think. The team is pretty excited for you to get your hands on some Trials gear this weekend. New armor, New weapons, a returning favorite, and even some perks to keep an eye out for...\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149298/Messenger_Perk_Desperado_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8chON4W.png)\n\n\n\nEven if you can\u2019t reach the Lighthouse, you can start collecting some new gear from wins 3, 5, and 7. Don\u2019t forget, we also have a weekly bounty that grants the 3-win-reward upon completion!\u00a0\n\n\nSee you out there. Don\u2019t go easy on me if we cross paths.\u00a0\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\ndmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 2017008, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week at Bungie - 2/11/2021", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/lioaed/this_week_at_bungie_2112021/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613087083, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/lhy9uc/this_week_at_bungie_2112021/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lhy9uc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_css_class": "bungie", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Bungie"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2f13ba30-3d46-11e9-8cd7-0e03d8e4b5da", "link_flair_text": "Bungie", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1187, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/lhy9uc/this_week_at_bungie_2112021/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "zY7TYzJEeuhqOK90ZOAa5GPbn8vaCQM0Yu1tSD254W4", "resolutions": [{"height": 33, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hMoxlvVCTASCFFefu6HzrGaJiv30i1z2RvevEWX09H8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37358a917f86f18afb50e0896d21062428100c4a", "width": 108}, {"height": 66, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hMoxlvVCTASCFFefu6HzrGaJiv30i1z2RvevEWX09H8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=766e2a3bb3ed2c67120ece2341b959d513b73056", "width": 216}, {"height": 98, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hMoxlvVCTASCFFefu6HzrGaJiv30i1z2RvevEWX09H8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9ea528a9c6c22f1c7c2dce34c7c6e1270a01e5a", "width": 320}, {"height": 196, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hMoxlvVCTASCFFefu6HzrGaJiv30i1z2RvevEWX09H8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85f6c6427f469daa7179cc240ebb35541b630ba", "width": 640}, {"height": 295, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hMoxlvVCTASCFFefu6HzrGaJiv30i1z2RvevEWX09H8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d21fbd4bc88b81c3c1fe466e378c03bc5e42d80", "width": 960}, {"height": 331, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hMoxlvVCTASCFFefu6HzrGaJiv30i1z2RvevEWX09H8.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae9654d4f4a7f5a2ca8f227f451d8621daeed461", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 590, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hMoxlvVCTASCFFefu6HzrGaJiv30i1z2RvevEWX09H8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d1afc29745323ace766c2b5f8b2b7f13555f5b2c", "width": 1920}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1613087094, "score": 1, "selftext": "[Source](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50102)\n\n---\n\nPardon our dust!

Challenges.\u00a0\n\n\nWelcome to the second-to-last TWAB of Season of the Hunt. Many of you have been navigating the secrets of the Harbinger mission, uncovering randomly rolled Hawkmoons and earning the Radiant Accipiter Exotic ship. Content-wise, we\u2019re coming to a close for the Season, and we\u2019re incredibly excited for what\u2019s to come in just a few short weeks. We\u2019ve been covering some upcoming quality of life changes to Destiny 2, like the return of Umbral Engrams, but it\u2019s almost time to take a peek at fresh content.\u00a0\n\n\n**Season of the [REDACTED] trailer goes live on February 2, 2021.\u00a0**\n\n\nBefore we get there, we have a new feature to cover, Seasonal Challenges, and a round of weapon-focused sandbox changes to walk through. As a warning, this is a pretty large amount of information in a small space. We've joked about \"meaty\" TWAB's before, but this one may feel a bit overwhelming if you rush through it. Let's take it slow, step by step, and get through it together in one piece.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Introducing: Seasonal Challenges\u00a0\n\nOver the last year, we\u2019ve been looking at ways in which we can reduce the amount of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) in Destiny 2. We\u2019ve recently made some changes to Seasons and how Seasonal content is available throughout a given year of Destiny 2. This week, we\u2019re looking to bounties and Bright Dust, introducing a new system not only to remove FOMO, but give fresh ways to earn XP and alternate rewards. To walk us through the ins and outs of Seasonal Challenges, we pass the mic to the Development team.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev team:** During production of Beyond Light, we started looking at the problems of bounty fatigue and FOMO, as well as Seasonal legibility (i.e., \u201cWhat is in a Season?\u201d and \u201cHow to I engage with it when I log in?\u201d). We created a few goals which we believe will improve the experience:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Provide a guide to new, returning, and veteran players for what to do today/this week.\u00a0\n&gt;* Guide the player through the Seasonal content, week-over-week.\u00a0\n&gt;* Encourage players to engage with complexities and nuances of the Seasonal activity and rituals.\u00a0\n&gt;* Reduce the penalties on XP and Bright Dust for missing a given week.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To solve these goals, we are introducing a new pursuit type for players \u2013 Seasonal Challenges. The Seasonal Challenges live on their own page, are accessed through the Quest Log or Season Pass, and are separated by week.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148555/Season13_Week01_Challenges_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/thnoJbu.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of how this feature works:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Every week, for the first 10 weeks of a Season, between 3 and 10 new Challenges appear automatically for players.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Some of the Challenges deal with the Seasonal content.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Others push players to complete strikes, Gambit, and the Crucible, or to focus on non-activity focused Destiny rituals, like gaining Power, unlocking Seasonal Artifact mods, or improving guns and armor.\u00a0\n&gt;* These Challenges can only be completed once per account, but once they become available, these Challenges can be completed at any time before the end of the Season, and do not need to be started or picked up from a vendor.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * As an example, if a player doesn\u2019t play for weeks 2 through 4, they can return on week 5 and have all of those Challenges waiting for them!\u00a0\n&gt;* Completing each Challenge awards XP, contributing to your Season Pass ranks.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Other rewards could be Bright Dust, Seasonal currency, or other interesting items!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In moving away from weekly bounties, which were restricted to broad objectives tied to ritual activities, we have taken more leeway with creating some interesting or more difficult Challenges. These may be things you are already doing, or things that test your ability. Some examples include:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Defeating Primeval Envoys in Gambit\u00a0\n&gt;* Defeating enemies in Nightfall: The Ordeal with Seasonal weapons\u00a0\n&gt;* Gaining Infamy or Valor ranks\u00a0\n&gt;* Acquiring the ritual weapon and its cosmetic ornaments\u00a0\n&gt;* Winning rounds in Trials of Osiris\u00a0\n&gt;* Completing a Grandmaster Nightfall\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Not all the Challenges will require that level of accomplishment, but the harder or longer the Challenge is, the more experience it rewards. Challenges that focus on the Seasonal activity and ritual mostly need the Season Pass to complete, but most of the ritual focused Challenges can be completed without the Season Pass. Overall, roughly 60% of the Seasonal Challenges do not require the Season Pass.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With the changes above, we are removing weekly bounties from the three ritual vendors (Zavala, Shaxx, and Drifter), Banshee-44, and the Seasonal vendor. These vendors will still have daily bounties which reward XP, and the three ritual vendors will still have repeatable bounties for those of you who want to pursue additional XP and Bright Dust.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Lastly \u2013 most of the Challenges disappear after the Season they were introduced, and anything that isn\u2019t claimed will be lost. We don\u2019t add any new Challenges after Week 10 \u2013 which should give everyone a few weeks to clean up any Challenges they didn\u2019t finish. Any Challenge that rewards unique or Seasonal items (currencies, lore books, Seasonal weapons, etc.) \u2013 can be completed as long as the Seasonal activity is in the game, but XP awarded for completing the challenge will only be available during the season it was introduced.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Let\u2019s Talk Bright Dust\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;Back before Beyond Light launched, we discussed some of the goals around the changes to Bright Dust. As a refresher, we wanted to change the way you earn Bright Dust and move more towards account-specific paths to give players with only one character significantly more Bright Dust than they've been earning over the last year. In Season 13, we\u2019ll be continuing to move toward these goals by adding Bright Dust onto Seasonal Challenges.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Since you no longer have to purchase weekly ritual bounties, each of the strike, Crucible, and Gambit Seasonal Challenges will award between 75 and 300 Bright Dust. We are also introducing an end-of-Season Bright Dust bonus \u2013 if you complete (nearly) all of the Seasonal Challenges, we are awarding a single 4,000 Bright Dust pile.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, each ritual vendor challenge (\u201cComplete 8 bounties\u201d) awards 120 Bright Dust for each character who completes it each week. And because this is prompted by the removal of weekly bounties, the only Seasonal Challenges that will be awarding Bright Dust are the ones that both Season Pass owners and free players can complete. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of how much Bright Dust you should expect to earn over the course of Season 13.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;**Seasonal Challenges Bright Dust (All Players)\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Free Seasonal Activities \u2013 6,000\u00a0\n&gt;* Seasonal Extra \u2013 4,000\u00a0\n&gt;* Total \u2013 10,000 Bright Dust\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Season Pass Bright Dust\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Free Path \u2013 7,500 (All Players)\u00a0\n&gt;* Paid Path \u2013 3,000 (Players who own Season Pass)\u00a0\n&gt;* Total \u2013 10,500 Bright Dust\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Weekly Ritual Vendor Challenge Bright Dust (All Players)\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* 120 Bright Dust per ritual vendor, per character, per week\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;   * 14,040 total if completing all required weekly Challenges over the course of Season 13\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, we still plan to offer weekly and repeatable Bright Dust bounties for Seasonal events, giving you a bit more Bright Dust towards desired rewards.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As a final note, please be sure to claim all Seasonal Challenges that award Bright Dust prior to the end of a Season. Once a Season ends, associated Challenges and their Bright Dust rewards will expire and can no longer be claimed.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s always exciting when we bring a new feature online for Destiny 2. We hope that the changes detailed above make it easier to create goals to complete each week. As always, we\u2019re eager to hear your feedback once you start finishing your first Seasonal Challenges, so please sound off with your thoughts!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Back to the Sandbox\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/143/143183/03292018_sandbox_header.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/29vKzdV.jpg)\n\n\nEvery Season, we have a collection of changes to the Destiny 2 sandbox to spice things up a bit. This Season, we\u2019re making some targeted changes to weapon archetypes that need some love as well as beginning some preparations for crossplay.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev team:** In preparation for crossplay, coming later this year, we\u2019re making some changes to the Recoil stat.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Currently, several weapon archetypes have their Recoil reduced by around 40% (dependent on archetype) when using mouse and keyboard. This results in an issue where players on mouse and keyboard are able to largely ignore the stability weapon stat, creating unintended discrepancies in weapon performance between controllers and mouse and keyboard.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The following weapon archetypes will have their mouse and keyboard Recoil adjusted closer to controller (reduced the difference from ~40% to ~20%).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Auto Rifle\u00a0\n&gt;* Scout Rifle\u00a0\n&gt;* Pulse Rifle\u00a0\n&gt;* Submachine Gun\u00a0\n&gt;* Hand Cannon\u00a0\n&gt;* Machine Gun\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In the case of Pulse Rifle, Submachine Gun, and Machine Gun, we will also be introducing some buffs. In some cases, these weapons will have less Recoil across both Controller and mouse and keyboard input methods compared to what\u2019s in the game today.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Submachine Guns are largely outclassed by Auto Rifles at medium range, and by Sidearms at short range, with player feedback often mentioning how hard they are to control. To address this feedback, we\u2019re introducing the following change:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reduced camera movement from firing a Submachine Gun by 24%.\u00a0\n&gt;* Pulse Rifles with the mouse and keyboard changes were kicking a little too much.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reduced camera movement from firing a Pulse Rifle by 7%.\u00a0\n&gt;* Machine Guns with the mouse and keyboard changes were kicking a little too much.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reduced camera movement from firing a Machine Gun by 9.5%.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We will pay close attention to how these changes play out when they go live, and plan to revisit individual archetypes in a future update as needed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Outside of Recoil adjustments, we will also be tuning a few weapon archetypes in Season 13. Looking through backend data and community feedback, we landed on the following:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Buffs**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Rocket Launchers have fallen behind other Heavy weapons in most measures of effectiveness, we\u2019re pushing them more into a burst damage role.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Increased Rocket Launcher damage by 30%.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Exotic Rocket Launchers have been adjusted individually and are affected by this change to different degrees.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Paired with the buffs to reserves from last Season, we\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll explode many more things in Season 13!\u00a0\n&gt;* Fusion Rifle usage is very low, and they feel like an unreliable choice in Crucible compared to Shotguns.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Increased Fusion Rifle damage falloff start distance based on Range stat. (6% with 0 Range, 16% with 100 Range)\u00a0\n&gt;   * Reduced camera movement from firing a Fusion Rifle by 9.5%.\u00a0\n&gt;* Breech Grenade Launcher usage is very low (outside of Mountaintop). We believe part of the reason is that the loop of \"hold the trigger to arm, then release to detonate\u201d is challenging to execute, particularly since projectiles can bounce off targets if the trigger is held\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Breech Grenade Launcher projectiles will now detonate on impact with a character, even if holding the trigger.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Nerfs**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* While Sniper Rifle usage has dropped in Crucible, we\u2019ve observed that it\u2019s hard to challenge someone with a Sniper Rifle \u2013 even if you get the first shot on an enemy, they can often respond and win the fight.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Increased ADS flinch to Snipers when taking damage from other players\u00a0\n&gt;* Swords are extremely dominant in PvE. At this time, 65% of players are using Swords for the majority of gameplay encounters in Destiny 2. While we are introducing a buff to Rocket Launchers to make them a bit more enticing, we feel that Swords do too much damage compared to other options.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reduced Sword damage by 15%.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Exotic Changes and Bug Fixes\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Some Exotic weapons lose their buffs when you switch weapons, which is intended. They would also lose their buffs when pulling out your Ghost Shell, which is not intended. Fixed that issue on these weapons:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Ace of Spades\u00a0\n&gt;   * Tarrabah\u00a0\n&gt;   * Hawkmoon\u00a0\n&gt;* Borealis and Hard Light now have a custom (quite short) animation for switching damage type.\u00a0\n&gt;* Duality\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Increased damage falloff distance by 1.25m (while both firing from the hip and aiming down sights).\u00a0\n&gt;   * Reduced maximum buff stacks from 7 to 5, each stack now grants more of a damage bonus, extended buff duration slightly.\u00a0\n&gt;* Sturm will once again reload any equipped Special slot weapon on kill provided the Special weapon's clip isn't full already and there's available reserve ammo.\u00a0\n&gt;* Fixed an issue that was preventing Merciless from increasing its charge rate on non-lethal hits.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Ah, and before we go \u2013 we are planning to take a quick tuning pass on Arbalest. This won\u2019t be ready in time for February 9, but we are expecting to have this touched later in Season 13!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\nNow, we know it can be difficult to understand the scale of buffs and nerfs without having these changes in your hands. Not to mention, there will be some new perks for you to hunt as you start navigating content in Season of the [REDACTED]. As always, we\u2019re excited to see these changes out in the wild on February 9, and will be eager to hear your feedback.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Crimson Days\u00a0\n\nEach year, we look to February as a time to celebrate bonds of friendship throughout the community. Guardians have come to know this celebration as Crimson Days. It was one of our first \u201cSeasonal\u201d events in Destiny 1, a tradition that we carried to Destiny 2. While there was great enjoyment of Crimson Days, we feel that it\u2019s been missing the mark in terms of quality over the last few years.\u00a0\n\n\nAs such, we have made the decision to discontinue Crimson Days moving forward. While we\u2019ll miss the event, this move will allow us to maintain focus for alternate Seasonal offerings, ranging from quests to activities and more. We have quite a bit planned for Season of the [REDACTED] and our hope is that we\u2019ve maintained, or even improved, the quality you\u2019ve come to expect from this upcoming release.\u00a0\n\n\nSome of you may be asking about the fate of Crimson Doubles, our once-a-year Crimson Days playlist. This mode is currently being shifted to the Destiny Content Vault but may return in the future.\u00a0\n\n\nMany thanks to every Guardian who has joined us over the years for this event. Crimson decorations may not be hung in the Tower, but we have no doubts that you\u2019ll continue to form Crimson Bonds over the years to come.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##BugTrax\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NQNPe4A.gif)\n\n\nFor those who may be new to the TWAB, welcome to the Player Support Report.

menu.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe new Harbinger activity went live this week to accompany the Hawkmoon Exotic quest... like a proverbial peanut butter and jelly. You can now finish this new activity to earn your catalyst to add some extra spice to Hawkmoon. The new activity also lets you earn random rolls so you can start hunting for the perfect one to fit your style. Play the tape!\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZT4a8PHcZM)\n\n\nCompleting the Hawkmoon catalyst from the Harbinger activity will not only bring your winged weapon to its full potential but also unlock the Bungie Rewards long-sleeve shirt for purchase. This Hawkmoon inspired shirt is the latest Seasonal offering available on your [Bungie Rewards page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/Rewards).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Sticking Around\u00a0\n\nAs we have mentioned in the past, we are moving to make Seasonal content stick around longer to reduce the amount of FOMO, otherwise known as \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d in Destiny 2. Our goal is to help players experience narrative beats and activities even if they start playing later after the Season has ended.\u00a0\n\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s sticking around from Season of the Hunt until the end of Year 4.\u00a0\n\n\n* Story missions will be able to be launched from a node in the Director.\u00a0\n* Wrathborn Hunts\u00a0\n* Adored quest will continue to be available.\u00a0\n* Crow\u2019s vender screen on Tangled Shore.\u00a0\n* Hawkmoon Exotic quest and Master activity.\u00a0\n* Seasonal Seal and Warden Title.\u00a0\n\n   * Seasonal Seal must still be earned by the deadline on the Bungie Rewards page. Due to an issue blocking the Triumph we will be adjusting this deadline.\n\n\nHere are a few things that will no longer be available at the end of the Season:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Crow\u2019s Bounties\u00a0\n* Messages from the Field\u00a0\n* Seasonal Artifact\u00a0\n* Season Pass\u00a0\n\n\nShifting to keep more of this content around after the Season ended has created some weirdness for Season of the Hunt, which was initially designed assuming the old model. This is why Crow was still hanging around in Spider\u2019s lair right after being unceremoniously kicked out earlier in the Season.\u00a0You may see other anomalies involving Crow in Season 13 as he'll be moving to a new destination while also remaining on the Tangled Shore to enable Season of the Hunt content tied to his inventory.\u00a0\n\n\nSeason 13 should avoid these rough edges as its content has been designed from the outset to remain throughout Year 4.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Umbral Engrams Are Back! (They\u2019re pretty insane)\u00a0\n\nBack in 2020, Season of Arrivals introduced a new feature called Umbral Engrams which allowed Guardians to Focus rewards to the type of weapons and armor rolls they most desired. The system was well-received by the community so we decided to do a little tuning and bring them back for Season 13 as well as future seasons in Year 4.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the new Seasonal activity will always provide the fastest path to earning new rewards. We want to ensure that regardless of how you spend your time in Destiny, Umbral Engrams allow you to chase new rewards.\u00a0\n\n\nSimilar to Season of Arrivals, Umbral Engrams will drop from completing a variety of content. We have pared back the number of activities they will drop from so you can focus on the following activities if you are looking to farm some Umbral Engrams:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Patrols\n* Strikes\n* Crucible\n* Gambit\n* The Ordeal\n* Public Events\n* Blind Well\n* Nightmare Hunts\n* Exo Challenges\n* Empire Hunts\n* New Seasonal Activity\u00a0\n\n\nNote: Umbral Engrams also have a chance to drop from defeating enemies anywhere in the game, so even if you're not grinding this list of activities and playlists, you\u2019ll still be earning some Umbral Engrams.\u00a0\n\n\nYou may notice fewer umbral engrams sitting in your inventory than before.\u00a0 While it was fun to watch umbral engrams rain down on players in season 11, the drop rates were higher than expected and so we are rebalancing the drop rate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThere will be a short quest to show players how to use the new Prismatic Recaster (read more about this below) to Focus Umbral Engrams. This quest is account-wide so you only have to do it once.\u00a0\n\n\n###Prismatic Recaster\u00a0\n\nThe Prismatic Recaster returns as a kiosk with the capability to change Umbral Engrams into Focused Umbral Engrams, which contain a smaller loot-table. Because Umbral Engrams are here to stay, the new Recaster will have different pages for each Season, and you will be able to Focus engrams to the Season of your choice.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148442/PrismaticRecaster_1080.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Nai1hVd.jpg)\n\n\nOnce you have used the Prismatic Recaster to Focus your Engram, you will still need to take it to the Umbral Decoder to claim your new reward!\u00a0\n\n\nNote: Season of the Hunt\u2019s Wrathborn rewards will not be featured on the Prismatic Recaster in Season 13, because players can still use the Wrathborn Lure to chase specific weapons and rolls.\u00a0\n\n\n###Prismatic Lens\u00a0\n\nWe have a new way to unlock different Focusing options for your Umbral Engrams through a new reward called Prismatic Lenses.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nA Prismatic Lens will unlock a new Focusing option so you can:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Target a narrower collection of gear.\u00a0\n* Target specific armor stats.\u00a0\n\n\nYou will be able to earn Prismatic Lenses by doing various activities in the game and you can track your progress towards unlocking lenses at the Prismatic Recaster. We don\u2019t want to spoil everything though - so we\u2019ll let you discover how to start earning these in Season 13.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Titles - A Gilded Age\u00a0\n\nOne of the most satisfying feelings in Destiny is watching your list of completed Triumphs fill up to unlock new Seals and Titles. We have some plans to further improve this feature and give you yet another way to flex on other Guardians in the Tower. Here is the Triumphs Design Team with the details.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Triumphs Design Team**: Hey everyone, welcome to a new year!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We wanted to share a change coming to Seals and Titles in Season 13. As I'm sure you've noticed, we've been shipping a Flawless and Conqueror Title each of the last three Seasons. We liked the idea of reengaging with Titles Season over Season, but we don't like the challenge and time commitment of doing the entire thing every Season. So, it's time to make a change!\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As always, we start with the goals:\u00a0\n\n\n* Allow players to show off their engagement with the core rituals season over Season.\u00a0\n* Preserve the value of earning the base Title.\u00a0\n* Decrease the amount of grind required Season over Season for players that want to earn them all.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Starting with season 13, if a player has completed the Seal for one of our core ritual Titles (Unbroken, Dredgen, Flawless, Conqueror), players will have a series of additional Seasonal objectives to gild that Title.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**But wait, what does *gilded* mean?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* A series of Seasonal objectives to gild a core ritual Title.\u00a0\n&gt;* A new border around the Seal in the Triumphs UI.\u00a0\n&gt;* A pip tracking how many times in your career that you've gilded a given Title.\u00a0\n&gt;* A new color and symbol for the Title over your head. So that you can show off, of course.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148442/Ungilded_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OYcU0P3.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**What do I have to do to gild a Title?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Once you finish the base Seal and claim your hard-earned Title, a list of optional Seasonal objectives will be revealed. By completing these Seasonal objectives you'll earn your gild for the Season.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148442/Gilded_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XDqEEMS.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**What happens when the Season is over?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Each Season, the optional gilding objectives will reset and may even change to fit the unique experiences of any given Season. All of the base objectives of the Title will be preserved, and your Title will revert to its typical purple coloring.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Which Titles will be affected?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The four core rituals of Trials, The Ordeal, Crucible, and Gambit.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Flawless\u00a0\n&gt;* Conqueror\u00a0\n&gt;* Unbroken\u00a0\n&gt;* Dredgen\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;**Feedback please!\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;These changes are a result of the constructive feedback we get from all flavors of players in the Destiny community. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Keep that feedback coming and happy Triumph hunting.\u00a0\n\n\n**Guardian Giveaways\u00a0**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148442/GG_2021_p1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XU5vMQ7.jpg)\n\n\nThis week, the Bungie Store is celebrating Guardians everywhere with the third annual Guardian Giveaways contest featuring curated collections of Destiny gear, including prizes like the sold-out Beyond Light Collector\u2019s Editions signed by the Bungie team.

Since then, all stats, files, and other data from Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, and Halo: Reach have lived on in remembrance at [halo.bungie.net](http://halo.bungie.net/).\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On **February 9**, the [halo.bungie.net](http://halo.bungie.net/) website will be taken offline permanently. Everyone is welcome to save their stats and files, however they can, if they'd like to save anything. Please keep in mind that our News articles, Forums, and Groups were imported into the current version of Bungie.net back in 2013.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, personal custom Halo avatars that are currently used on Bungie.net will be removed on February 9 due to its functionality living on halo.bungie.net. We are exploring options to bring those back in some capacity, but we recommend saving them to your computer in the meantime.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* We're investigating an issue with Sony where Playstation users can't send invites through the Companion App or Bungie.net.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Lightseeker Triumph isn't unlocking after claiming all five feathers from the Harbinger mission.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Birds of a Feather Triumph is not unlocking when players complete the Harbinger activity when all players have Hawkmoon equipped.\u00a0\n&gt;* VO lines are not playing during the Harbinger activity.\u00a0\n&gt;* The black Blight orbs left behind by the High Celebrant won't open portals if shot by Sidearms.\u00a0\n&gt;* The High Celebrant will always show \"Immune\" damage, even with the Wrathborn buff active. The High Celebrant will still take the proper damage if the buff is active. This will be resolved in a future update.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Augment lockout timer occasionally resets during the final encounter against Taniks.\u00a0\n&gt;* Sometimes the wrong tether box gets tethered during the final encounter of the Garden of Salvation raid.\u00a0\n&gt;* The plates in the puzzle room during the Shuro Chi encounter in the Last Wish raid sometimes won't work if a Titan Ward of Dawn or Warlock Well of Radiance touch them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

I don\u2019t want to lean too far into the \u201cWe\u2019re listening\u201d meme but it\u2019s 100% true that we take community feedback to heart and are absolutely considering community concerns and suggestions as we continue to evolve our plans for 2021 and beyond. Earlier this week, Assistant Game Director Joe Blackburn put out a Tweet mentioning this and that we will give an update to the community with a deeper dive into the state of Destiny.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Last year, I said Destiny's Best Days are ahead. Seeing what's coming, I believe this more than ever. But we have work to do to get there. 2021 is going to be a little different for Destiny. Taking some time to validate our plans, but expect a state of Destiny 2021 next season.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 Joe Blackburn (@joegoroth) [January 19, 2021](https://twitter.com/joegoroth/status/1351661922001711108?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n\nWe love Destiny 2 and love having the privilege to work on it. We\u2019re excited about some of the changes we have next Season and will have some more to lay out over the next few weeks as well.

action.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it? Since the last TWAB, you\u2019ve gotten your hands on Hawkmoon. The Dawning has come and gone. Next-generation consoles received some wonderful enhancements. You\u2019ve released a crow from their cage, and Lord Saladin watched as you decimated your foes with Stasis in the Iron Banner.\u00a0\n\n\nOn the Bungie side of things, we took a breather. This last year has been full of challenges that none of us expected. Even through everything 2020 had in store, we were able to get Beyond Light and Season of the Hunt in your hands. This did come at a bit of a cost, though, and we needed some time to recharge our batteries for a new year. We have no doubt that 2021 will have mountains to climb and unexpected surprises, but we\u2019re all excited to get back into the groove for a new year of Destiny development.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s get this party started. We\u2019ve got four TWABs between you and a fresh Season of Destiny 2 content. You\u2019re hungry for what we've got planned, and we\u2019re eager to dish out the goods. First up, we\u2019ll be looking at a few changes to vendors, Dreaming City and Moon rewards, and some sandbox tuning for Hunter Stasis abilities in the Crucible.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Rewards Update: Dreaming City and the Moon\u00a0\n\nSince the launch of Beyond Light, we\u2019ve been collecting what feels like a metric ton of feedback on various Destiny systems. While we\u2019ve shared some plans related to rewards, DDoS protection on consoles, crossplay and transmog, we have new details on rewards from two of our more recent destinations: The Moon and the Dreaming City. **Rewards Area Lead Justin Dazet** will be walking us through some changes in response to player feedback.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Justin:** Last month, Assistant Game Director Joe Blackburn [spoke about some changes we were making to gear in Season 13](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49957) in response to some feedback. Today we\u2019re going to briefly chat about what some of these changes are as they relate to our back catalog of expansions, and the reasoning behind them.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First let\u2019s review a list of what you\u2019ll see starting in Season 13:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Reissued Dreaming City Reverie Dawn and Moon Dreambane armor.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * These will also drop with high stats when earned in Shattered Throne or Pit of Heresy.\u00a0\n&gt;   * The final chest in Pit of Heresy will no longer drop a fully Masterworked Dreambane armor piece.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Instead, the Dreambane armor piece that drops will have 7 armor energy and is guaranteed to drop with at least a +16 in two different stats and higher stats overall.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Dreambane class items will not drop from this chest.\u00a0 \u00a0\n&gt;* Reissued 4 weapons for Dreaming City with new Perk Pools.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Waking Vigil, Sleepless, Vouchsafe, and Retold Tale.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Dreaming City weapons that drop in the Shattered Throne dungeon can roll with perks that are unavailable from drops from other reward sources.\u00a0\n&gt;* Reissued 4 weapons for the Moon with new Perk Pools.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Premonition (Pit of Heresy only), Heretic, Blasphemer, and Apostate.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Weapons that drop in the Pit of Heresy dungeon can roll with perks that are unavailable from drops from other reward sources.\u00a0\n&gt;* Expanding Lost Sector Legend and Master rotation to 4 Moon Sectors.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * K1 Logistics, K1 Communication, K1 Crew Quarters, and K1 Revelation.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We are making these changes to help preserve the relevancy of the destinations, specifically some of the pinnacle end-game activities that still exist there. To get more specific around the actual experience, activities where re-issues are acquired will be heavily weighted towards rewarding re-issued gear over capped gear -- though the exact weighting and mechanisms may differ. For example: In the Dreaming City if you have already obtained an infusion capped weapon, it will not drop for you again.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148338/ArmorWeapon_All_16-9.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While not every gear source or Legendary reward will be kept up to date for the entire lifetime these destinations are available, we do believe there\u2019s high value in targeting some specific activity drops for continued relevancy to give you more options for where to spend time as you seek to improve your arsenal.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Turn in those Tokens\u00a0\n\n\nSince Destiny 2 launched, Guardians have been amassing vendor reputation tokens. These could be turned in for Legendary gear, which would usually be dismantled for Legendary Shards and materials. Looking to the future, the team is excited to update the ways in which you earn reputation with ritual vendors and the rewards that come from them. Dazet, back to you!\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Justin:** The rewards for continuous ritual playlist completion has been a subject that\u2019s come up several times as we\u2019ve looked over Beyond Light feedback, and we\u2019re happy to announce some changes coming soon to Gambit, Crucible, and strike reward structure.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Firstly, we\u2019ll be adding two new unique weapon rewards to each of the three playlist rituals (so six total across all three activities). These weapons are in addition to the ones added in Season of the Hunt, and continue to have a small chance to drop at the end of each activity.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Second, starting in Season 13 for Gambit and Crucible (Valor) and in a future Season for strikes, rank rewards will be visible on the ritual vendors. Each Season you\u2019ll be greeted by a row of rewards, progression toward which will be earned automatically as you complete relevant playlist activities.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Instead of having rank rewards dropped automatically into your loot stream, they now will be picked up manually from the vendor lists. We feel this gives much better visibility into what you\u2019ll be earning as you progress, and helps you make better choices about where to spend your time.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148338/Reputation_Rewards_Initial_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LTbqW37.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Progression is on a per-ritual basis. You can be on Rank 10 for Crucible and Rank 4 for Gambit, for example. You\u2019ll reset your rank right at the vendor by picking up the final reward.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Rewards for each individual ritual are as follows:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Rank 4: 3x Upgrade Modules\u00a0\n&gt;* Rank 7: 3x Enhancement Cores\u00a0\n&gt;* Rank 10: Seasonal Ritual Shader (changes to 3x Enhancement Cores after resetting your rank)\u00a0\n&gt;* Rank 13: 2x Enhancement Prisms\u00a0\n&gt;* Rank 16: Seasonal Ritual Emblem (changes to 2x Enhancement Prisms after resetting your rank)\u00a0\n&gt;* Reset Reward: Ascendant Shard (changes to Exotic Engram after resetting your rank)\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Every rank-up awards a base Ritual Engram just like before. Additionally, each of the above ranks also awards a Prime Ritual Engram.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/148/148338/Reputation_Rewards_Repeatable_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JYBfcb3.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Due to this automated progression, Crucible Tokens and Crucible Token Gifts are no longer needed and will be deprecated into junk that will delete as a full stack starting in Season 13. So, cash those tokens in before the end of the Season, and get ready to earn some Masterwork materials!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Taking a pass: Revenant Shatterdive &amp; Fissures\u00a0\n\n\nThe conversation and feedback on rewards wasn\u2019t the only thing we were tracking over the holiday break. Many of you have been spending time in the Crucible, experimenting with Stasis and all of the ways in which it can change the flow of a PvP match. Prior to the break, we had a round of tuning for Warlocks. Next up, we\u2019re looking at Hunters, but also have some comments on our approach to future Stasis tuning as we head in to the new year. Please welcome **Combat Area Lead Tomonori Kinoshita** back to the TWAB to talk through our goals for Stasis abilities in PvP.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Tomo:** Over the holiday break we saw Trials go live, and with that a wealth of valuable feedback from the community. Along with this feedback, we have been tracking data from Trials and identified some short-term changes, as well as more mid-term goals we are focusing on in the coming weeks and months.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Short term goal: Address outlier Stasis abilities to keep subclass decision making interesting.\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Reduce the potency of Shatter Dive + Whisper of Fissures against Guardians, going live with Update 3.0.2.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Shatterdive\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * Now has damage falloff vs. unfrozen targets\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;      * Max range damage reduced from 50 to 5\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;      * Damage reduction during ability reduced from 50% to 25%\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;   * Whisper of Fissures\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * Reduced max-min damage vs. non-super players from 42-22 to 30-4\u00a0\n&gt;      * Reduced max-min damage vs. super players from 42-22 to 16-2\u00a0\n&gt;      * Reduced detonation radius vs. players from 10m to 9m\u00a0\n&gt;* Investigate the efficacy of the Stasis Titan Behemoth Super. We want to let the above change settle to see where the Behemoth stands in our PvP hierarchy, but this is next on our radar.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Mid-term goal: Improve PvP subclass usage and win-rate balance.\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Addressing Stasis ability outliers will help us lower the ceiling, but we also want to pull up other underperforming Light subclasses.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Mid-term goal: Review our ability-to-gunplay balance in PvP.\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Destiny is a game about both explosive space magic moments and intrinsically satisfying gunplay. Especially in our 3v3 playlists, the usage of abilities has climbed as we introduce more and more ways to charge them quickly.\n&gt;* We\u2019re still in very early discussions, but we\u2019re looking into restoring a better balance where proper gunplay is rewarding in these playlists.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\nA few of you noticed that prior to our holiday break, we were able to get a few sandbox changes delivered faster than expected. Thanks to changes on Destiny 2\u2019s backend and the Destiny Content Vault, our patch pipeline is indeed better than before! That said, some changes won't happen at light speed, as our team wants the appropriate time to collect feedback, check the data, and test proposed changes.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce these changes have been validated, we\u2019ll be eager to get you details via TWABs, blog articles, and more.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Worldwide Community\u00a0\n\nSometimes, it can be difficult to think of how large the Destiny community has become since 2014. It seems no matter where you may be in the world, you might bump in to a fellow Hunter, Warlock, or Titan. Last year, we bolstered our efforts with the addition of two international community managers. Join us in welcoming a third to the team! Introducing our new Russian Community Manager, **Ivan Yanyushkin**.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Ivan:** Privet!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;My name is Ivan and I'm the latest community manager added to the team for Russian speaking Guardians. In Destiny 2 I enjoy making raids more complicated by doing them with fewer than six people and endlessly roaming around Europa on my Warlock, which for me is a meditating experience.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Some of you might know me from my past work at Blizzard Entertainment, where I worked as a community manager for different titles. This experience will help me, but I will also be thankful for your guidance. Feel free to reach out to tell me what works, what doesn\u2019t, and how things can be improved for the Destiny community. One day, when real-life gaming events finally become possible again, I will be happy to meet you in person. But for now, let\u2019s stay in touch on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/BNG_Ivan), [VKontakte](https://vk.com/kirristar), and on the [Russian Bungie Forums](https://www.bungie.net/ru/Forums/Topics).\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s an honor to work with such an amazing community. My job will be to pass the voice of the players to developers, help local content makers grow, manage Russian social media channels, and take care of many other duties. I\u2019ll do my best to be Ivan the Great not the Terrible!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;P.S. Hopefully one day I\u2019ll even get used to the fact that Hydras explode after death :)\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Spasibo.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Keeping You Updated\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BDPF2Gy.gif)\n\n\nThrough the holiday break, Destiny Player Support was at the ready, providing vital information to players encountering bugs, seeking workarounds, or just asking for help with their network setup. This week, their eyes turn towards an upcoming Hotfix, preparing you all for the incoming update.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n**UPDATE 3.0.2\u00a0**\n\nToday, January 14, background maintenance for Update 3.0.2 will begin. Below is a timeline of events:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n* January 14, 10 AM PST (1800 UTC): Destiny 2 background maintenance for Update 3.0.2 begins.\u00a0\n* January 14, 2 PM PST (2200 UTC): Destiny 2 background maintenance for Update 3.0.2 completes.\u00a0\n* January 19, 8 AM PST (1600 UTC): Destiny 2 maintenance for Update 3.0.2 begins.\u00a0\n* January 19, 8:30 AM PST (1630 UTC): Players are removed from activities and won't be able to log back into Destiny 2 until 9 AM PST when Update 3.0.2 is available.\u00a0\n* January 19, 9 AM PST (1700 UTC): Destiny 2 Update 3.0.2 is rolled out across all platforms and regions. Players can log back into Destiny 2 at this time. Ongoing maintenance is expected to conclude at 10 AM PST.\u00a0\u00a0\n* January 19, 10 AM PST (1800 UTC): Destiny 2 maintenance is expected to conclude.\u00a0\n\n\n**UPCOMING RESOLVED ISSUES\u00a0**\n\nBelow is a list of some issues expected to be resolved with Update 3.0.2:\u00a0\n\n\n* Hive bosses, In Ananh, Brood Queen and Xillox, were not counting as Hive boss kills in bounties.\u00a0\n* Some players couldn't respawn if they died during the boss fight of the Inverted Spire strike.\u00a0\n* Players could get out of environment in several Crucible maps.\u00a0\n* Some quest items were not dropping in the Moon Freeroam activity. This prevented completion of several \"Essence\" quests, such as Essence of Rage, Essence of Insanity, and Essence of Servitude.\u00a0\n* The Unrelenting perk was not triggering health regeneration.\u00a0\n* MIDA Multi-Tool's catalyst wasn't dropping from Competitive Crucible wins.\u00a0\n* Taken Psions were replicating too rapidly in some Prophecy dungeon encounters.\u00a0\n* Garden of Salvation flawless completions were not awarding the \u201cInherent Perfection\u201d Triumph.\u00a0\n* The High Celebrant sometimes wouldn\u2019t take damage nor go to the Ascendant Plane.\u00a0\n* Fixed an exploit where players could have \"Shelter From the Storm\" permanently applied in the Deep Stone Crypt raid.\u00a0\n* Fixed an issue where Cloudstrike hits on the Divinity cage counted as two precision hits.\u00a0\n* Fixed an issue where the Grandmaster Nightfall timer was set to 30 minutes.\u00a0\n* Fixed an issue on PlayStation 5 preventing clan rosters from loading.\u00a0\n\n\n**DUST AND ECHOES**\n\nAlmost [nine years ago](http://halo.bungie.net/), stats and files from our previous franchise, *Halo*, stopped getting updated on Bungie.net. Since then, all stats, files, and other data from *Halo 2*, *Halo 3*, *Halo 3: ODST*, and *Halo: Reach* have lived on in remembrance at [halo.bungie.net](http://halo.bungie.net/).\u00a0\n\n\nOn **February 9**, the [halo.bungie.net](http://halo.bungie.net/) website will be taken offline permanently. Everyone is welcome to save their stats and files, however they can, if they'd like to save anything. Please keep in mind that our News articles, Forums, and Groups were imported into the current version of Bungie.net back in 2013.\n\n\n**KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0**\n\nWhile we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\n\n\n* The Exotic Ship Reward from the High Celebrant mission is not properly showing that it is a \u201cRare\u201d chance reward in the activity description. Chances for this reward increase with each activity completion.\u00a0\n* Portals aren't opening when the High Celebrant leaves because the black orbs take no damage. Players can mitigate this issue by not using Sidearms and not shooting the orb as it immediately spawns.\u00a0\n* Enemies in Crucible and PvE aren't colorblind-friendly when highlighted.\u00a0\n* The Special Finisher mod no longer unlocks for new players.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Bomber mods don't work when Hunters have the Dragon's Shadow Exotic equipped.\u00a0\n* The Overload Shot on Auto Rifles doesn\u2019t proc if you hold down the trigger right after reloading, even though it does the Overload animation.\u00a0\n* Some players receive the BIRD error code trying to get to the Wall of Wishes in the Last Wish raid.\u00a0\n* Sometimes the Vault encounter in the Last Wish raid won't let you read icons nor spawn enemies after slamming on a plate or finishing a phase.\u00a0\n* Sometimes Riven doesn't get stunned on the second level in the final encounter of the Last Wish raid.\u00a0\n* The Forfeit Shrine Ascendant Challenge completion doesn't count towards the Ascendant Champion or Honed for Speed Triumphs, blocking the Cursebreaker Seal.\u00a0\n* The Run the Gauntlet Triumph doesn't unlock when completing the time trial in the Cimmerian Garrison Ascendant Challenge.\u00a0\n* Ahamkara Bones are missing in the Shattered Throne dungeon and multiple Ascendant Challenges.\u00a0\n* Players will sometimes go into a Nightfall with 16 people when they try loading into the Tower.\u00a0\n* Sometimes dialogue gets cut off at the end of a Wrathborn Hunt.\u00a0\n* For Hunters using the Way of the Warrior subclass, Combination Blow sometimes stops working and doesn't give Gambler's Dodge back.\u00a0\n* Non-Exo characters are receiving Exo specific dialogue on Europa.\u00a0\n* The Light of the Dawning emblem cannot equip stat trackers.\u00a0\n* The Coaxial Bonds ornaments for Ophidian Aspect causing the bottom-left of the screen to glitch/flicker.\u00a0\n\n\nFor a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

We wanted to share some of the plans to improve rewards as well as a few other exciting things coming up.[ The whole update](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49957) is definitely worth a read, but I stole some bullets:\u00a0\n\n\n* In Season 13, we\u2019re adding six new Legendary weapons to our ritual activities, two each for strikes, Gambit, and Crucible.\u00a0\n* In addition to the weapons above, Nightfall strikes are getting three unique weapons, with The Palindrome, The Swarm, and Shadow Price all making their Destiny 2 debuts. If you\u2019re brave enough to take on Grandmaster Nightfalls, you will be also able to earn Adept versions of these weapons.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Transmog will be coming with Season 14. More details to come. (See [work-in-progress](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147208/Transmog_01.png) [mock-ups](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147208/Tranmog_02.png)!)\u00a0\n* DDoS protection for Destiny 2 players on all consoles will be coming in Season 13.\u00a0\n* The Vault of Glass raid returns in Year 4.\u00a0\n* Crossplay is coming in 2021.\u00a0\n* Two strikes (Fallen S.A.B.E.R. and Devil\u2019s Lair) are coming to Destiny 2 in Season 13.\u00a0\n* Legendary and Master Lost Sector rotation will be expanded to include the Lost Sectors on the Moon in Season 13, and there will be new three new pieces of Exotic armor to chase.\u00a0\n\n\nThat very same day, [Update 3.0.1](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49928) went live with several important fixes as well as next-gen enhancements for consoles so you can experience the beauty of Destiny 2 with moar frames and moar FOV! We wrote up an [article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49925) that covers these new enhancements in detail as well as the new ability to pick up bounties from the Companion App and the return of the Prophecy dungeon.\n\n\nThis week also saw the return of Hawkmoon. The highly sought-after Exotic Hand Cannon makes its debut into Destiny 2 with a reworked perk that no longer relies on RNG but still packs a punch. Season Pass owners can now visit Spider to set off on the quest to claim their Hawkmoon.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/IvEa4m7k_WU)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##The Dawning\u00a0\n\nThis very merry morning we shared a peek at this year\u2019s Dawning event that kicks off next week!\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/0whKG-O74nc)\n\n\nEva Levante is coming to town! She has new cookie recipes and new gifts for all the good Guardians... even if they did adopt Darkness powers.\u00a0\n\n\nBut I digress. Check out our [Dawning page](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/TheDawning) for a quick look at what the event has to offer this year. The Tower is going to be all dressed up again, and we\u2019re putting the Griswold touch on the decorations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YIWeU5q.jpg)\n\n\nEveryone knows the best gifts vaporize your enemies. Glacioclasm is a new Legendary Fusion Rifle being introduced during this event with random rolls available so each one you open is special. Plus - Glacioclasm is just fun to say. Try saying it without smiling, I dare you! I double-dog dare you. Anyway, here is a preview of the weapon.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/Glacioclasm_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vJRBhl0.jpg)\n\n\nAs you are flying around delivering baked goods you will need a new ship to spread cheer in style. Eva has a new Exotic ship that you will be able to upgrade throughout the event to change its look. You will be able to customize the engine streams, different spawn effects, and unlock a new animated shader unique to the ship!\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/JB_Ship.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DYBGbAi.jpg)\n\n\nEva has also set up a fun new celebration for this year's Dawning that involves even more gifts... for you! As the community generates Dawning Spirit by completing activities you will be able to progress a special community pursuit with your cookie skills and then find new gifts waiting for you under the tree. The big glowy one, you can\u2019t miss it. We don\u2019t want to spoil all the surprises but you may find some upgrade materials in these gifts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThere will also be some fun stuff at the Eververse store as well. All of the new items added to the store will be available at some point for Bright Dust with the exception of the Glee Barrage and Merry Maker weapon ornaments and Happy Trails finisher which will be available for Silver. Here is a preview of a few of the Sparrows, Ghost Shells, and a ship that are sure to get you in the spirit.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/JJ_DawningSparrows_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/spFdKlP.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/JJ_Emberwick_16-9.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/JJ_Tangled_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Zkhlf9S.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/JJ_LittleHelper_16-9.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/JJ_SilverwingKestrel_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sRXO86d.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Super Smash Warlock Melee\u00a0\n\nShortly after launch, we put out a [hotfix to reel in Stasis a bi](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49861)t. When we made these changes we wanted them to have as much efficacy as possible and that meant using broad strokes to cover a lot of ground. This led to us hitting Penumbral Blast's range harder than many players felt was necessary. Upon review and hearing the feedback we felt that while Penumbral Blast's range needed to come in - there is room to push it back out and have it feel more consistent when hitting targets at range. Here is a preview of patch notes coming in a hotfix next week.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Penumbral Blast:\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Projectile range increased by 37%\u00a0\n* Minimum distance to cast ranged melee reduced by 32%.\u00a0\n\n\n   * This allows you to throw the ranged melee closer to targets.\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##One... Million... Dollars\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/147/147575/Game2Give_Banner_Static_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3OeLVYn.jpg)\n\n\nYou have been absolutely crushing it raising money to support the Bungie Foundation and Children\u2019s Miracle Network Hospitals. As of this writing you have raised 1,036,555 so far and you still have until December 13 to donate to a cause that benefits sick kids across the country. If you haven\u2019t donated yet, there are some great[ prize incentives listed here](https://www.helpmakemiracles.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&amp;id=1238&amp;eventID=2952) for donating.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSpeaking of incentives, now that we have hit $1 million we are going to start releasing Destiny lore readings by the following special guests for every $50,000 donation milestone we hit!\n\n\n* Giacomo Gianniotti: Dr. Andrew DeLuca, *Grey\u2019s Anatomy*\n* Morla Gorrondona: Eris Morn, *Destiny 2\u00a0*\n* Erika Ishii: Ana Bray, *Destiny 2\u00a0*\n* Peter Jessop: Guardian/Exo Male, *Destiny 2\u00a0*\n* Neil Kaplan: Dominus Ghaul, *Destiny 2\u00a0*\n* Nyambi Nyambi: Jay Dipersia, *The Good Fight\u00a0*\n* Brandon O'Neill: Uldren Sov, *Destiny 2\u00a0*\n* Moira Quirk: Emissary/The Exo Stranger/Orin, *Destiny 2\u00a0*\n* Zehra Fazal: Guardian, *Destiny 2\u00a0*\n\n\nThank you to everyone who has donated or volunteered to help raise money through streams and other incentives. It\u2019s always amazing what this community can do when it comes together. Finish strong!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Spreading Update Cheer\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RQKy6zB.gif)\n\n\nWe had another deployment this week which means our player support specialists were watching closely and tracking any issues that popped up.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###CONNECTION AND SERVER ISSUES\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Since Update 3.0.1.1 on December 8, we\u2019ve been investigating various connection issues, including the following error codes: PRUNE, and WEASEL. The BEE, CACAO, CENTIPEDE, and CHICKEN error codes have since been resolved.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###TRIALS OF OSIRIS REWARD SCHEDULE\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Trials of Osiris is expected to return on December 18. Due to the delay of launching Trials, a few changes were made to the reward schedule: During the first four weeks, the Flawless chest will drop an Adept Weapon. The fifth week will drop an armor piece, with subsequent weeks switching the rewards back and forth between Adept weapons and armor [as previously mentioned here](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49676). Adept weapon mods will drop each week.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###PS4 FRIENDS LIST UPDATE\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Since the launch of Beyond Light, we\u2019ve been investigating an issue for PlayStation 4 players who could only see a small number of their friends online in their Roster. We discovered this issue only affected those with more than 100 friends in their Roster. This issue has been resolved, but after further testing we discovered another issue affecting how online friends are displayed. That issue will be fixed on December 14 in Hotfix 3.0.1.2.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###XBOX SERIES X|S FREEZING ISSUE\n&gt;\n&gt;While unlikely, it\u2019s possible that Destiny 2 may freeze up when signing out of an Xbox Live profile while inside the game. We recommend quitting out of the Destiny 2 app first before signing out. If the game does freeze, players can press the Xbox Guide button on their controller, select Destiny 2, and then select Quit. This issue will be fixed on December 14 in Hotfix 3.0.1.2.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###VESPER OF RADIUS UPDATE\n&gt;\n&gt;[Last Friday](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1335058145966604288), we disabled Vesper of Radius due to it being possible to cast a Rift while falling off a ledge which, when combined with Stasis, could result in a quick lethal combo to opposing players in Crucible. Rift energy wasn\u2019t being used, so it was possible to repeat again right after execution. This issue will be fixed on December 17 in Hotfix 3.0.1.3.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###SPOILS OF CONQUEST\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;[We\u2019re investigating an issue](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1336089485797281793) where players can put their Spoils of Conquest raid currency in their vault, resulting in it disappearing. While we continue our investigation, **players should refrain from putting Spoils of Conquest in their vault.\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###**NEXT-GEN UPDATES\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 players who are migrating from Xbox One and PlayStation 4, respectively, will need to download the full-size version of Destiny 2 to get all of the benefits of our next-gen update. For more information, please read our [TWAB from December 3](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49918).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;PlayStation 4 players upgrading to PlayStation 5 may need to highlight Destiny 2 on the PlayStation 5 home screen or PlayStation 5 Store, click the three dots menu, and select the PlayStation 5 Upgrade download. [Click here for more information](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/upgrade-ps4-game-to-ps5-version/).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Along with our next-gen updates, we discovered that some player settings on PC were transferred to players\u2019 console accounts if they are Cross Saved. Until we can implement a fix, console players experiencing FPS or screen-tearing issues can go into their game\u2019s Settings &gt; Video, and choose \u201cReset to Default\u201d to resolve these issues.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* We\u2019re investigating reports that cross-gen matchmaking sometimes doesn\u2019t work.\u00a0\n&gt;* FPS issues on PC. Please help us determine the cause by posting your information in [this thread](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/257771427?page=0&amp;sort=0&amp;showBanned=0&amp;path=1).\u00a0\n&gt;* PlayStation Remote Play reverts controller remapping and may not function at all.\u00a0\n&gt;* Deafening Whisper doesn\u2019t trigger the Abyssal Extractors perk on Nezarec\u2019s Sin Exotic helmet.\u00a0\n&gt;* Nezarec\u2019s Sin Exotic helmet no longer triggers for five seconds after the second kill and all buff kills are now 2.5 seconds. This is intentional, but we failed to call it out in the patch notes for Update 3.0.0.1. The \u201coriginal\u201d functionality was a bug that applied 2.5 seconds twice for each subsequent kill.\u00a0\n&gt;* Necrotic Grip doesn\u2019t give melee energy on corrupted combatant kills. This is intentional, and the Exotic will be updated to remove the text mentioning this.\u00a0\n&gt;* Necrotic Grip doesn\u2019t poison combatants when a ranged melee attack breaks their shield from full.\u00a0\n&gt;* Honed for Speed and Ascendant Champion Triumphs don't unlock when completing the Keep of Honed Edges Ascendant Challenge.\u00a0\n&gt;* Toland doesn\u2019t appear in the Shattered Ruins Ascendant Challenge.\u00a0\n&gt;* Surrounded perk buff does not linger when using Surrounded Spec mod.\u00a0\n&gt;* True Prophecy has been removed from world loot pool. This is intentional.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Shotgun Dexterity arm mod shown in legs category in Collections.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Line in the Sand weapon model has random protrusion when held.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Unrelenting weapon perk isn\u2019t functional.\u00a0\n&gt;* Lost Lament quest sometimes needs to be abandoned and reacquired to continue.\u00a0\n&gt;* Thunderlord is currently missing its scope.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Ahamkara Bones may not spawn in the Agonarch Abyss Ascendant Challenge.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not all going on a big hiatus at once. We will still be around. This is the time of year where many of us like to take some time away from work to be recharged and enjoy the cold wet darkness of the PNW at home with the fam. I mean, we were at home already, but now we\u2019re not talking to our computers all day.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made sure that the feedback is still flowing, and that you have the latest info on ongoing issues and anything new that pops up. The Dawning isn\u2019t the only thing starting next week, we also have raid challenges going live for Deep Stone Crypt so keep an eye out for that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild year. It\u2019s almost hard to remember what it was like to be in the studio at this point. Depending on how everything shakes out it will be nice to get back there sometime next year. Until then, we will keep plugging away from our offices, living rooms, garages, patios, and other random rooms around our homes. We still have a lot of work to do. We shared some of our short-term plans with you this week, and there is a whole lot more coming in 2021 as well. See you next year[!](https://i.imgur.com/wCrpc43.jpg)\u00a0\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo\u00a0**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id":

nest.\u00a0\n\n\nHello, and welcome to the second TWAB of Beyond Light. We\u2019ve got a bit to cover today, so we won\u2019t spend too much time on introductions. Season of the Hunt kicked off proper on Tuesday. If you haven\u2019t jumped in just yet, we have some wonderful web lore to get you prepared. I wasn\u2019t mentally prepared for part 2...\u00a0\n\n###**[IMMOLANT PT. 1](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49746) // [IMMOLANT. PT 2](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49747)**\n\n###[**TWO DRINK MINIMUM**](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49844)\n\n\nWrathborn Hunts have begun. We still have the Deep Stone Crypt Raid, The Dawning, Trials of Osiris, Iron Banner, and more to look forward to over the course of the Season.\u00a0\n\n\nFirst stop: The raid.\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##On Your Marks. Get Set. Raid.\u00a0\n\nSeason of the Hunt isn\u2019t the only thing making its grand entrance this week. At 10 AM PST on Saturday, November 21, the Deep Stone Crypt will become available.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/htWuEvknQeE)\n\n\nWe\u2019ve talked through Contest Mode, shown off some fancy rewards, but we wanted to get in a final reminder before the show begins.\u00a0\n\n\n**World First Verification Timeline\u00a0**\n\n\nOnce the raid has been conquered, we will announce that the activity has been completed from [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie) on Twitter. After this, our teams will start diving into the data to verify that the first completion was clean. Our hope is to be able to announce the winners shortly after World first, but we want to ensure our validation efforts are sound. Ultimately, our goal is to have a post congratulating the winning team on Monday, November 23.\u00a0\n\n\n**Contest Mode Reminder and a Quick Stasis Update\u00a0**\n\n\nFull details on [Contest Mode](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49649) can be found in the [This Week at Bungie \u2013 10/15/2020 article](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49649).\n\nQuick bullets that all should be aware of:\n\n\n* Contest Mode will cap all players at 20 Power below each encounter for 24 hours.\u202f\u00a0\n* Artifact Power will\u202fbe disabled\u202fduring Contest Mode.\u202f\u00a0\n* Your team\u2019s Power Cap goal is 1230 for all the encounters.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n* Being above 1230 will\u202fnot\u202fprovide any additional advantage in the final fight.\u00a0\n\n\nEarlier this week, an issue was discovered where Stasis was doing large (and we mean insanely huge) amounts of damage to bosses. The team worked at lightning pace to develop a fix for [Destiny 2 Hotfix 3.0.0.3](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49861), thus preventing impact to the upcoming raid! We have a few more notes on general Stasis balancing later in the TWAB, so keep reading if you want to know more! This may not be a piece of Contest Mode, but we wanted to make sure to call this out for those who may have seen an interesting video or two over the last few days.\n\n\n**There Will Be Loot\u00a0**\n\n\nNow, it wouldn\u2019t be a race if there wasn\u2019t something on the line. While many of you may have seen these rewards on our Instagram or even a preview on the Bungie Store website, we wanted to make sure to show these off in a TWAB before the raid released!\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**World First Raid Title (don\u2019t call it a belt)\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The first Fireteam of 6 to complete the Deep Stone Crypt raid will be declared World First by Bungie from @Bungie on Twitter after verification from our analytics team. Official rules can be [found here](https://www.bungie.net/en/help/article/47218).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/145/145718/RaidBelt_Teaser_202.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hhvrGzr.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Day 1 Raid Emblem\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Complete the Raid within 24 hours with Contest Mode active (by 10 AM PST on Nov 22) to unlock this unique emblem.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142818/Raid_Emblem5.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/J3EBZ0k.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Jacket Quest: Parka Edition\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Complete the raid by 9AM PST on December 1 to unlock the Bungie Rewards Deep Stone Crypt Raid Jacket for purchase.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/145/145718/RaidJacket_16_9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xm32ZKf.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, there are two deadlines that players should be aware of:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Deadline to Claim Reward Code: December 31, 2020 9 AM PST\u00a0\n&gt;* Deadline to Purchase: December 31, 2020 11:59 PM PST\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For additional details, please refer to your [Bungie Rewards page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/rewards), or the [Bungie Store pre-order page](https://bungiestore.com/collections/whats-new/products/preorder-bungie-rewards-destiny-2-beyond-light-deep-stone-crypt-raid-jacket).\u00a0\n\n\nNow, only a few questions remain...\n\n\n* Have you gotten your Power high enough?\u00a0\n* Do you have your raid team assembled?\u00a0\n* Are you prepared for battle?\u00a0\n* \u2026and for those of you who may not be racing, who will you be watching?\u00a0\n\n\nSee you Saturday. It\u2019s going to be a blast.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Securing the Entrance\u00a0\n\nOur Security team has been working on a variety of projects to sharpen our tools for cheat detection. In the coming weeks we\u2019ll begin rolling out a new security measure for newly created accounts on PC. Our hope is that this deters some players from breaking the [Code of Conduct](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Legal/Terms).\u00a0\n\n\nFor a quick explanation of what\u2019s coming, our friends from the Security team will be taking the stage to walk you through the process of SMS verification.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**What is SMS verification?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Bungie is implementing a quick account validation step for free-to-play players who want to access our high-stakes PvP modes in Destiny 2 on PC. Free-to-play accounts (PC only) will need to link and verify a cell phone number to their accounts via Bungie.net before being able to access those activities.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**What activities are high-stakes?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Trials of Osiris, Iron Banner, and Competitive PvP playlists are examples. As this feature rolls out, we will be looking to how it can grow, and potentially expanding it to alternate activities in the future.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Why are we doing this?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Unscrupulous players can negatively impact everyone\u2019s gameplay experience and undermine the hard-earned achievements of others. Bungie takes the threat of cheating seriously. We will continue implementing systems to help verify that accounts engaging in Destiny 2 activities are honoring our Code of Conduct and Terms of Service.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**What do you need to do?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you are a free-to-play Destiny 2 PC player you will receive a notice in-game the first time you try to access a protected activity. This will provide you with a \u201cVerify Now\u201d link to follow to Bungie.net and process your SMS linking. When you enter your cell phone number and request a verification code you will receive a quick text message with \u201cBungie Code: ######\u201d. \u202fOnce you enter that code on the Bungie.net page to complete your verification process you can sign back into the game to get immediate access to the activity you want to play.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\nOnce this feature is live, free-to-play PC players will see an image in-game which will walk them through the signup process.\n\n\nFor announcements regarding this security rollout, please follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp) on Twitter. We will also release some help articles over the next week to give full details on the upcoming feature!\u00a0\n\n\nAs a reminder, if you encounter any players that you suspect of cheating or breaking our terms of service, please use the in-game report tool and submit a report using our [contact form on Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13967).\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Game2Give 2020 Fundraising Campaign \u2013 Light Keepers\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/145/145718/Game2Give_Header.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AjLzetF.jpg)\n\n\nOver the years, this community has proven time and time again that gaming does good.

The team has been hard at work over the last year building abilities and Supers powered by the Darkness. Enemies around the solar system are shaking in fear of your Stasis powers, including your fellow Guardians in the Crucible.\u00a0\n\n\nDepending on when this article goes live, a hotfix may or may not be in the wild. We have some notes from the development team on what\u2019s changing in [Destiny 2 Hotfix 3.0.0.3](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49861).\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Development Team:** We have seen a lot of feedback on Stasis\u202fsince Beyond Light launched last week. We\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a ton of fun to use, but certain aspects\u202fof this new subclass can be frustrating to go up against (looking at you, Shadebinder Warlocks). We have a few minor tweaks planned to go out in Hotfix 3.0.0.3\u202fthis week.\u202fOur goal here is to do some early tuning to\u202frein Shadebinders\u202fback in while still\u202fmaintaining their overall efficacy and power\u202ffantasy.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Stasis Changes:\u202f\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Stasis Breakout Damage reduced (110-&gt;90hp).\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Adjusted the curve that reduces breakout damage using resilience.\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;   * Increased the damage reduction effect resilience has so that higher tiers of Resilience are more valuable.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;   * Caps out at 90 Resilience.\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;* Penumbral Blast (Stasis Warlock Melee)\u202fprojectile\u202fspeed\u202freduced by 20%.\u00a0\n&gt;* Penumbral Blast (Stasis Warlock Melee)\u202frange reduced (was\u202f28m\u202fnow\u202f16m).\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;* Winter Wrath (Stasis Warlock Super) duration reduced (30s -&gt; 24s).\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;* Winters Wrath Light Attack (Stasis Warlock Super) cost reduced (5% per burst -&gt; 4.5% per burst).\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;* Cold Snap\u202fseeker\u202fspeed reduced\u202fby 23%.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Against Guardians:\u202f\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Cold Snap freeze duration lowered (4.75s -&gt; 1.35s).\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;* Ice Flare Bolts freeze duration lowered (4.75s -&gt; 1.35s).\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;* Penumbral Blast (Stasis Warlock Melee) freeze duration lowered (4.75s -&gt; 1.35s).\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;* Winters Wrath Heavy attack (Stasis Warlock Super) no longer affects players who are not encased.\u202f\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With all that said, we believe strongly in the \u201ccosmic ice\u201d wizard fantasy in\u202fPvE\u202fso we\u2019re trying to target changes where we can towards the PvP experience specifically.\u202fWith Stasis we\u2019ve tried to push the sandbox in new directions\u202fand that increases the likelihood we introduce something *spicier* than normal.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When it comes to crafting new abilities, we believe the risk of shipping something a little hot is better than playing it safe and shipping something that doesn\u2019t get you excited. As\u202falways,\u202fwe\u2019re going to be using data, playtesting, and feedback to help refine our direction and we\u2019re going to keep responding. This will not be the last change to Stasis this Season. As we get closer to future changes, we\u2019ll make another appearance in the TWAB for a patch note preview.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\u202ffor playing, and we\u2019ll see you out there in the wild.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Let\u2019s Talk Loot\u00a0\n\nSince Beyond Light launched, we\u2019ve been working through a whirlwind of feedback. What feels good, what needs work, and most importantly, how are you feeling? Today, we\u2019ll be talking through a bit of player feedback concerning loot, and some short term plans the development team is working on.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Development Team:** As Beyond Light has launched we've been tracking your feedback around loot, particularly weapons, and wanted to take a moment to let you know how we are processing it. Today we're going to talk mostly about the short-term, with more information to follow in the future around the long-term as we work through those problems.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Infusion caps are intended to help keep Destiny 2 evolving and ensure that every release the new rewards are exciting and relevant to the meta. However, we agree with your feedback that there\u2019s currently not enough variety in the world loot weapons available to players this season.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To that end we are adding back in a selection of weapons that will help alleviate this issue. We will also be watching to see how the landscape changes with the addition of weapons from Season 12 and this week\u2019s Raid launch. We also agree that getting near-cap weapons from random world drops is frustrating. Thus, we are removing those from the pool, and are weighting drops more heavily towards newer weapons.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Here\u2019s a list of adjustments to the world loot legendary weapons pool you\u2019ll see with our **November 24** hotfix:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Remove all legendary weapons that hit their infusion cap at the end of this season\u00a0\n* Add all of the Seventh Seraph weapons from Season 10\u00a0\n* Add all of the Season 11 seasonal and planetary reprisal weapons\u00a0\n* Weight drop chances so the newer an item is, the more likely it is to drop.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we are not yet ready to dive into the long-term strategy yet, we are listening to feedback and watching how the player build landscape evolves over these first few weeks of Beyond Light, and incorporating that feedback as we plan out future Seasons.\u00a0\n\n\nFeedback never stops, and we\u2019re always excited to hear how you\u2019re feeling about Destiny 2. Keep it coming.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Bashing Some Bugs\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/26lZe9j.gif)\n\n\nThis last week has been a whirlwind.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, what\u2019s said above is incredibly important! Charity initiatives to help those in need, the upcoming raid race, new security measures, and Stasis tuning are great things to see. It\u2019s always a fun time collaborating with the various teams of Bungie to get you a weekly dose of information.\u00a0\n\n\nThat said, I\u2019m just itching to get back into the game. It\u2019s about time for me to go hunting. See you next week.\n\n\n\n...wait, I'll more than likely see you on Saturday for a raid race. Either way, I hope you are in good health, and wish you a good weekend.\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame",

Light.\u00a0\n\n\nNo more waiting, Beyond Light has arrived! There was some turbulence at the start, but our team of experts worked the problem and remained vigilant in making sure Guardians were ushered through the queue and could safely touch down on Europa.\u00a0\n\n\nMillions of Guardians have answered Variks\u2019 distress call and began to explore the icy moon. Secrets have been discovered, enemies have been vanquished, your quest for Exotic loot has begun. Whether you have already finished the campaign or are still eagerly awaiting for your chance to hop in for the first time this weekend, there is still a lot of great Destiny content ahead of you!\u00a0\n\n\nSpeaking of new content, we just unveiled a new trailer for Season of the Hunt and a [Season page](https://www.bungie.net/seasonofthehunt) to go with it. Check it out!\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/A32M1Lz9eIY)\n\n\nSeason of the Hunt is live now, but it really gets going next week when the Season\u2019s mission kicks off and Wrathborn hunts begin. Prepare to stop Xivu Arath from attempting to seize power with the help a familiar ally. Until then, don\u2019t forget to grab the new Seasonal Artifact. Just try not to mess up Zavala's office while you\u2019re in there.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Fine, It\u2019s Cosmic Ice\u00a0\n\nWe are seeing many Guardians out in the wild who have claimed Stasis as their own and embraced a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be unnatural. There are many Aspects and Fragments still left to be discovered that will allow you to further customize your new powers. We wanted to give you some additional info on how these new status effects will hinder your opponents. This is not info the Vanguard would tell you.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n###Stasis Slow\u00a0\n\nAgainst Combatants:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Slow will shut off combatants\u2019 movement abilities and slow their movement.\u00a0\n\n\nAgainst Players:\u00a0\n\n\n* Slow will reduce movement speed.\u00a0\n* Reduce ability regeneration rates.\u00a0\n* Suppress movement abilities (jump, dodge, etc).\u00a0\n* Reduce the following weapon stats:\u00a0\n\n\n   * ADS speed\u00a0\n   * ADS move speed\u00a0\n   * Weapon reload speed\u00a0\n   * Weapon handling\u00a0\n   * Weapon kick direction\u00a0\n* Reduces weapon accuracy.\n\n\n###Stasis Freeze\u00a0\n\nAll targets:\u00a0\n\n\n* Freeze can be shattered by damage. Shattering a freeze causes it to do AOE damage to the frozen target and all other nearby targets, including other frozen targets.\u00a0\n* Freeze lasts for some duration before crumbling off.\u00a0\n* Unlike shattering, a freeze that crumbles does not do any damage to the frozen enemy or nearby enemies.\u00a0\n\nAgainst Combatants:\u00a0\n\n\n* Freeze will lock all non-boss combatants in place for the duration of the effect.\u00a0\n* Bosses will automatically shatter out after some duration.\u00a0\n\n\nAgainst Players:\u00a0\n\n\n* Freeze will lock players into place when applied for the duration of the effect.\u00a0\n* While frozen, players will have their class ability replaced with a new Breakout ability that allows players to exit their freeze early at the trade-off of health. The damage this breakout does can be reduced by the Resilience stat. The more Resilience the less damage you take.\u00a0\n* Players can activate their Supers to immediately breakout in Super state.\u00a0\n\n\nAgainst Players in Roaming Supers:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Locks players in place until broken out.\u00a0\n* Players will quickly shatter out and take a small amount of damage.\u00a0\n\n\nAgainst One-off Supers:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Suppresses Super and locks players in place until broken out or expires.\u00a0\n* All player freeze rules apply here.\u00a0\n\n\nStasis is a new damage type and we're excited to see how Guardians harness this new power. As always, we are monitoring community feedback and checking analytics data to consider for future tuning of the sandbox.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile we are on the topic of Stasis, we have some new wallpapers for you!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/145/145100/16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZmRwIKn.jpg)\n\n\n[4K Download](http://downloads.bungie.net/images/Wallpapers/Stasis/Groupshot_Stasis_EN.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/145/145100/1-1_Titan.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2EtAyjG.jpg)\n\n\n\n[4K Download](http://downloads.bungie.net/images/Wallpapers/Stasis/Titan_Stasis_EN.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/145/145100/1-1_Warlock.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ht13BbJ.jpg)\n\n\n\n[4K Download](http://downloads.bungie.net/images/Wallpapers/Stasis/Titan_Warlock_EN.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/145/145100/1-1_Hunter.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/w7urImN.jpg)\n\n\n\n[4K Download](http://downloads.bungie.net/images/Wallpapers/Stasis/Titan_Hunter_EN.jpg)\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Flight Dynamics Officers\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MpKDUS7.gif)\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to launch new content our player support team are in the virtual room where it happens, making sure you are informed of the status of the game and keeping track of known issues.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###CONNECTION AND SERVER ISSUES\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Ever since Monday, November 9, we\u2019ve been investigating server stability and various error codes, including GUITAR and ARUGULA. We\u2019ll provide more information once it becomes available.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###BEYOND LIGHT LICENSES AND SEASON PASSES\n&gt;\n&gt;Many players have reported to us that they purchased Beyond Light but don\u2019t have the Season Pass and can\u2019t access the campaign after the first mission.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Season Passes aren\u2019t included in the Standard Edition of Beyond Light, so players who purchased this edition will have to purchase the Season Pass in the game. Additionally, Season Passes can\u2019t be shared between accounts.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For those sharing the expansion on console, the main console has to download Beyond Light first before the second console can access that content.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For platform-specific players:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###XBOX\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Players should look at their order history to confirm that their transaction of Beyond Light was successful. If it wasn\u2019t, they should contact [Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/) for assistance.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For players who purchased Beyond Light successfully but still can\u2019t access the expansion, they may need to manually reinstall all add-ons:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Highlight Destiny 2\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Press the Menu button,\u00a0\n&gt;* Select \"Manage game and add-ons\"\u00a0\n&gt;* Press the Menu button,\u00a0\n&gt;* Select \"Manage installation\"\u00a0\n&gt;* Manually reinstall all add-ons\n&gt;\n&gt;Please note that the Game Pass version of Beyond Light doesn\u2019t include a Season Pass.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###PLAYSTATION\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who purchased Beyond Light but can\u2019t access the expansion should [restore their Destiny licenses](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/12181). If players still experience issues, they should contact [PlayStation Support](https://support.playstation.com/) to verify their purchase.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###STEAM\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Players on Steam should go to their \u201cLibrary,\u201d right-click on Destiny 2, click \u201cProperties,\u201d click the \u201cDLC\u201d tab, and make sure that Beyond Light and all appropriate DLC is installed. If Beyond Light isn\u2019t listed, players need to purchase Beyond Light or contact [Steam Support](https://help.steampowered.com/en/).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###MID-WEEK UPDATES\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;[Earlier this week](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1326322891034554369), we disabled the Rose Hand Cannon from use due to its RPM still being 150 instead of 140. This issue will be resolved in a future update.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We also noticed that Legendary drop rates were changed in the EDZ Widow\u2019s Walk Lost Sector, which we corrected on Wednesday.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###NVIDIA REFLEX AND DESTINY 2 PC\n&gt;\n&gt;Destiny 2 on PC now supports integration with the NVIDIA Reflex SDK for compatible graphics cards. This improves responsiveness and reduces \u201cclick-to-display\u201d latency. Players can tweak their experience by following the direction in our [NVIDIA Reflex Lot Latency Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49656).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###PC MIGRATION AND BATTLE.NET ENDING SOON\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Beginning on December 1, 2020, at 9 AM PST, Blizzard's Battle.net accounts will no longer be available for users to log in with on Bungie.net or the Destiny Companion app, nor will users be able to migrate their Battle.net account to Steam.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Users who only have a Battle.net account linked to their Bungie profile are strongly encouraged to either link another platform to their profile, or to perform PC migration to Steam (unless you already have a Destiny 2 Steam account).\u00a0[Click here for more information.](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49818)\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The \u201cFabled Warrior\u201d Triumph doesn't count weapons that were purchased from the Monuments to Lost Lights Exotic Archive.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Europa patrol \u201cTo the Nth Power\u201d can\u2019t be progressed by Warlocks using Stasis\u00a0\n&gt;* Sometimes Vendors and enemies have model deformations.\u00a0\n&gt;* Players who dismantle Stasis Fragment quests must wait a week before picking up a new one.\u00a0\n&gt;* The One-Inch Punch finisher won\u2019t kill enemies if players have Stasis equipped.\u00a0\n&gt;* Kill-based weapon perks may work inconsistently on Stasis-frozen shatter kills.\u00a0\n&gt;* Xbox players are experiencing crashes while in the Tower, especially when opening their Vault.\u00a0\n&gt;* Cutscenes suffer from severe stutter and result in an extremely poor viewing experience for some PC players.\u00a0\n&gt;* Many Multi-part emotes stop playing after they enter animation.\u00a0\n&gt;* Warlock's \"Frostpulse\" can fail to freeze target if there's a difference in elevation.\u00a0\n&gt;* When using PlayStation Remote Play, controller settings reset to default.\u00a0\n&gt;* On Xbox One, the chat volume slider does not affect incoming voice chat volume.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

We\u2019ll see you again next week with another round!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\nAs we transitioned from Season of Arrival into Season of the Hunt, we held a small event in the Last City for you to spend the final few hours jumping around with your friends and watching the Traveler do.[.](https://imgur.com/7VN31r9). Traveler things. Big thanks to everyone who showed up for the final hours of Season of Arrival. If you weren\u2019t able to see it, we uploaded the [short cinematic that ushered in the new era of Beyond Light for you here](https://youtu.be/t9EFvcmLaXA).\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s a shorter TWAB this week, but we know you are busy with new stuff to do. We will be monitoring the community conversation around loot, Stasis, and everything else you have feedback on.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s been pretty inspiring getting to watch this team put this release together from home. This is another first for us and though we definitely miss getting to see each other at the studio, Bungie loves a chance to take on a new challenge. Plus, it will never not be funny watching kids and pets crash meetings.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI know everyone here at Bungie is proud of Beyond Light and Season of the Hunt and we all want to thank you for playing. We hope you enjoy the rest of the launch week and the Season to come.\u00a0\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo\u00a0**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame",

on right now.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat a week. It started out with a brand new ViDoc showcasing Bungie developers giving you a behind-the-scenes look at what we\u2019ve been cooking up from home. Now we\u2019ll pause the TWAB for 15 minutes so you can go watch it in all its glory. Even if you already watched it, go watch it again. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll wait on you.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/qgnPREMEfI4)\n\n\nThat was your first look into Season of the Hunt, as well as a deeper dive into Beyond Light, Stasis, New Light, and our plans for Year 4. [We also mentioned that most Seasonal content is going to be sticking around throughout the year](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49675) and showed off a new calendar for Beyond Light and Season of the Hunt. Start writing these dates in your calendars, or I guess like - programming them into your virtual calendars. You do you.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/143/143174/BeyondLight_Launch_Calendar_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/K8urVAf.jpg)\n\n\nWe followed that up by pushing out the Beyond Light launch trailer this morning featuring some good vibes and a familiar soundtrack. It\u2019s one of the last action-packed previews of Beyond Light you\u2019ll get before it launches in less than a fortnight. We'll pause the TWAB one more time so you can watch it, but this is it. No more pauses after this!\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cthLUnEqT5k)\n\n\nThat\u2019s all we got for you this week...\u00a0\n\n\nNah, just kidding. We got a lot more to cover. Let\u2019s get to it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Progression Changes\u00a0\n\nThe start of any new Destiny expansion begins with a Power climb as you\u00a0 experience the campaign and play through the story missions. After finishing that up and completing some additional quests and activities, you\u2019re usually around what we call the \u201cSoft Cap\u201d and will need to start earning Powerful rewards to continue to increase Power so you can tackle some of the more aspirational activities in the endgame. After you reach the \u201cHard Cap\u201d then there is an additional 10 Power you can earn through earning pinnacle rewards if you choose to hit the \u201cPinnacle Cap.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHere are the new Power Caps you are aiming for when the next Season begins on November 10:\u00a0\n\n\n* **Soft Cap: 1200\u00a0**\n* **Hard Cap: 1250\u00a0**\n* **Pinnacle Cap: 1260\u00a0**\n\n\nWhen you first log in next Season, all of your weapons and armor will be at 1050 Power or higher. If you have anything already over 1050 it will be unchanged, and anything under will be brought up to 1050. All new players will start at 1050 as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n###Powerful Reward Changes\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve heard a lot of feedback from players for more opportunities to earn Powerful rewards from the activities you enjoy most. We have a change coming that will allow you to have a chance to earn Powerful rewards from strikes, Gambit, Crucible, and from Seasonal drops all the way up until the Hard Cap. It will still be much quicker to continue to complete all the Powerful reward sources each week, but if you just want to play strikes or Crucible matches all day every day, you can continue to earn Powerful rewards.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe hope this helps you to continue increasing your Power during the period when you are still close to the Soft Cap and may find completing some of the Powerful sources like The Ordeal very difficult.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n###Tokens and Collections\n\nDestiny is at its best when you are shooting aliens, getting loot, and becoming more powerful. That gameplay loop breaks down when the best way to increase your Power can be standing in the Tower, handing tokens to Lord Shaxx.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nStarting next Season, gear received from Collections and turning in tokens and will have a lower Power than in previous Seasons. Gear earned through token purchases will be 20 Power below your Power Level and Collection buybacks will be capped at 1050 Power.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Economy Changes\u00a0\n\nSome currencies and items have changes coming either at the end of this Seasons or in the near future. Here is what to expect when you login next Season.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n###Materials with No Home\u00a0\n\nWith several destinations going into the Destiny Content Vault, many of you have been wondering what is going to happen to the currencies found in the areas currently underneath the Pyramids. The simple answer is that there are no changes to these currencies in Season of the Hunt, and you will be able to continue to spend them at vendors normally.\u00a0\n\n\nStarting in Season 13, Phaseglass Needles, Alkane Dust, Simulation Seeds, and Seraphite will be no longer accepted by vendors. For those of you that still have unspent stockpiles at the end of Season of the Hunt, Spider will be kind enough to offer a small Glimmer exchange to take them off your hands. But you\u2019ll realize the best value by spending them before that point, so make sure you turn in your stockpiles before the end of next Season.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThere are other items that will be removed from your inventory at the end of Season of Arrivals. Some, like Faction Tokens, have not had a purpose in quite a while, and others, like Expired Ramen Coupons, never really had a purpose but held some sentimental value. We know that it might hard to part with those, but it\u2019s time to let them go.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCheck out this [Help article for the full list of items that will no longer be in your inventory](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49668) at the start of Season of the Hunt.\u00a0\n\n###Bounties\n\nBack in [late April](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48993), we shared some plans on how to tackle the problem of \u201cbounty fatigue.\u201d We have made some shifts to seasonal bounties and reduced their importance on earning seasonal currency and seasonal progress. We\u2019re happy with these changes, but still want to continue to improve the bounty system overall.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOne of the plans we previewed was to eventually replace weekly bounties with a new mechanism to provide players with a set of non-expiring and account-scoped objectives each week that will grant lots of Season rank progress. We\u2019re still working on that system and will share more on it before its targeted release of Season 13.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n###Season Pass\n\nThe Season Pass you've come to know since Shadowkeep is largely staying the same. There will be new weapons and armor to earn off both the free track and the owned path. One big change we are making is adding Bright Dust to the Season Pass.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[As mentioned before](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49002), we wanted to change the way you earn Bright Dust and move more towards account-specific paths to give players with only one character significantly more Bright Dust than they've been earning over the last year. Here is the high-level look at the changes coming next Season.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n* Season Pass free path will now offer 7,500 Bright Dust\u00a0\n* Season Pass owned path will now offer 3,000 Bright Dust\u00a0\n* Weekly Bounties will now award 100 Bright Dust\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWith these changes, the vast majority of players will be earning more Bright Dust than before. One of our goals here is to not have a system that pushes you to try to grind out every weekly bounty on all three characters every single week. Whether you are a three-character player or only play a Hunter, Bright Dust will be more available when earning ranks on the Season Pass. We will also be making a change to the timing of Season Pass rank purchases which will be available starting in week five instead of week nine.\u00a0\n\n\nWe have more plans for improving how you earn Bright Dust coming in Season 13 and will continue to monitor your feedback.\u00a0\n\n\nI\u2019ve been talking a lot. Let\u2019s change it up. Here is Design Lead **Justin Dazet** to tell you about some changes Spider is making to his wares and to answer a question we have been seeing about the [customization updates](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49575) we are making to your Ghosts.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Spider\u2019s Dealings\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;**Justin Dazet**: Spider is going through some changes in Beyond Light. Though a notoriously savvy black-market dealer, our favorite four-armed friend has been largely the same for quite some time now. But the impending journey to Europa has finally given him a reason to tune up the materials exchange and make two key changes.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First, Spider will no longer be selling Legendary Shards. This exchange was removed mainly because it was not seeing enough use, particularly when compared with the other exchange offers. After reviewing player balances and the frequency with which this exchange was accessed, it was an easy decision to free up the space for something much more interesting.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In place of the Legendary Shard exchange, Spider is now selling Enhancement Prisms. These highly valued items come at a cost \u2013 400 Legendary Shards per Prism \u2013 and he\u2019s stingy with them so you can only purchase three a week. But we wanted to give those of you with higher balances a way to transmute your Legendary Shards into something a little more valuable than planetary materials and Upgrade Modules.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Second, we\u2019ve taken another look at how the Enhancement Core exchange works and made some changes. The ascending cost mechanism has been removed, and in its place, Spider will now sell you five Enhancement Cores a day for fixed price of 30 Legendary Shards each. While this does limit the number of Cores you can acquire from him each day, we feel a consistent price is a clearer experience with less chance to accidentally spend large quantities of Legendary Shards.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;More importantly it\u2019s also cheaper. In the old purchase model, you\u2019d pay 310 Legendary Shards for five Enhancement Cores (10, 20, 40, 80, and then 160). In the new model you\u2019ll only pay 30 Shards each, which equals out to 150 Legendary Shards for five Enhancement Cores. So, while it does limit your acquisition rate, it actually will save you 160 Legendary Shards every five Cores!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###Got to Go Fast\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Finally, we\u2019ve seen a few people wondering if you\u2019ll be able to equip the Ghost mod Speed Demon with other mods like Guiding Light in the new system, and we have some good news for you: You won\u2019t need to. Starting in Beyond Light all Sparrows, both Legendary and Exotic, will innately summon instantly, even without the Transmat Preloader perk. As a result, there is no need for a Ghost mod to impact this functionality, so Speed Demon was not carried forward into the new system.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you\u2019re already driving around a Sparrow with Transmat Preloader, you can keep using it and it will work just fine. Or you can pull it from Collections again and get two new perks. Newly created Sparrows will no longer roll on Transmat Preloader, so you have a chance to get yourself an extra perk and still retain that instant summon speed.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hop on that newly instant-summoning Sparrow and zip on over to check out Spider\u2019s new offers. He\u2019s ready and waiting to wrap those four greedy arms around some of your wealth and make you a deal you can\u2019t refuse.\u00a0\n\n\n###Eververse\u00a0\n\nStarting in Season of the Hunt, Bright Engrams will now contain all Eververse content from Season 1 to three Seasons prior to the current Season (excluding content from special events like Festival of the Lost, the Dawning, etc.). Here are some practical examples:\n\n\n* Season 12: Bright Engrams contain all content from Seasons 1 through 9.\u00a0\n* Season 13: Bright Engrams contain all content from Seasons 1 through 10.\u00a0\n\n\nAs always, as you open more Bright Engrams, your chances for earning things you don't own increases. There will be instances of duplicate drops, but the Engram will be weighted to grant you things you might be hunting.\u00a0\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Down to the Wire\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OS2F75R.gif)\n\n\nIt\u2019s time now to check in with our Player Support team for the latest on known issues and important information on the state of the game.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###WORLD ACTIVITIES\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;When Beyond Light and Update 3.0.0 release on November 10, 2020, some world activities will be removed. These removals are not related to the Destiny Content Vault but are general game updates.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players should complete any activities and quests they have left if they want to claim rewards from them.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Flashpoints (Weekly Engrams should be claimed before November 10 or they will be removed).\u00a0\n&gt;* All Destination Adventures.\u00a0\n&gt;* World Quests from Year-1 locations, such as Enemy of my Enemy, Exodus Black, and Data Recovery.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###INVENTORY ITEM REMOVAL\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;With the start of Year 4 and the introduction of the [Destiny Content Vault](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49668) on November 10, certain items will be deprecated from player inventories that correspond with Vaulted destinations, activities, and campaigns.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Click here](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49668) to review a list of items, quests, and currencies that will be removed from player inventories at the start of Year 4.

The issue resulting in account lockouts for early code redemption has now been resolved, and players can now safely redeem their codes prior to November 10.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###TITLES AND SEALS\u00a0\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;With Moments of Triumph and Season of Arrivals coming to a close, players are strongly encouraged to **claim and equip** the titles located in their Seals so that they will correctly count as claimed.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* \u00a0The Warlock\u2019s top tree on the Dawnblade subclass can trigger the Icarus Dash cooldown when playing on PC.\u00a0\n&gt;* Players can\u2019t dismount from their Sparrow using the dismount button on a controller if their Ghost is out.\u00a0\n&gt;* Some players report that they\u2019re receiving the Baboon error more frequently.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\u00a0\n\n\n##Nominees\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AJFU55m.gif)\n\n\nIt\u2019s now time for our Movies of the Week.

It\u2019s always nice to start off your day delivering a new ViDoc or exciting new launch trailer. The train carrying the hype is nearing its destination though, and Beyond Light will be arriving in less than two weeks! It\u2019s almost time to start counting the sleeps until the big launch.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNext week we will have a preview of some of the patch notes coming with the big update on November 10. We want to leave plenty for you to discover on your own in Beyond Light and Season of the Hunt and are excited to let the game do the talking, but we will still check in next week for one last TWAB before launch.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSee you then[!](https://i.imgur.com/h0eRg6B.jpg)\u00a0\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame",

sandbox.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore we kick this TWAB off, I have to ask: Have you watched the new story trailer for Beyond Light yet? No? While we aren\u2019t going to dive deeply into spoiler territory between now and launch, this is the moment where we say it\u2019s time for you to go dark if you're looking to experience the expansion with no knowledge of what's coming.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you\u2019re hungry, it\u2019s time to dig in.\u00a0\n\n##[Beyond Light: Story Trailer](https://youtu.be/k6c6M0rKW7s)\u00a0\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/k6c6M0rKW7s)\n\n\n[Eramis](https://youtu.be/DVynPzDZ0zM) is on the warpath.

Meet 120\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/143/143183/03292018_sandbox_header.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RPqOvlL.jpg)\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, we began a conversation about sandbox tuning for Beyond Light. Armor modifications are getting some hefty changes, from reloads to raids. If you missed it, check out the October 8 TWAB. This week, our focus shifts to the weapons in your arsenal. As with our mods preview, we have a collection of patch notes accompanied by developer commentary. Alright, we ready?\n\n\nLet\u2019s pass the microphone over to the Dev Team for some juicy details.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev team:** Hello! Today, we\u2019ll be covering some changes to a few specific weapons and weapon families. For those of you who don\u2019t have much knowledge of our sandbox, each weapon has a specific \u201cframe\u201d that is also tied to its associated rate of fire (RoF). We\u2019ve included both of these for a bit of clarity, as many players default to RoF when talking about various weapons. As an example, \u201cAggressive\u201d Hand Cannons currently have a RoF of 110 rounds per minute.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Hand Cannons:** We're making changes to give hand cannon subfamilies more diversity, and more reasons to use each.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* **Aggressive\u00a0\u00a0**\n\n\n   * Increased RoF from 110 to 120.\u00a0\n   * Broke out Aggressive Hand Cannons, allowing custom tuning of stats (e.g. damage falloff for 100 range in this subfamily now starts at 32m).\u00a0\n\n\n* **Adaptive and Precision\u00a0**\n\n   * Range stat now has more impact on minimum damage falloff range for both archetypes.\u00a0\n\n      * Damage falloff for 100 range now starts at 25m, was 20m.\u00a0\n   * Precision Hand Cannon\u00a0\u00a0\n\n      * (180 RoF) magazine scaled up by 37 percent.\u00a0\u00a0\n      * Note: This also affects Exotics with that rate of fire.\u00a0\n\n\n* **Lightweight (folded in to Adaptive)\u00a0**\n\n\n   * Moved all Lightweight Hand Cannons (150 RoF) to the Adaptive subfamily (140 RoF).\u00a0\n\n\n      * This includes Luna\u2019s Howl and Not Forgotten.\u00a0\n      * One Exotic Hand Cannon will retain 150 ROF.\n\n\n         * We aren\u2019t going to leave it to speculation.\n         * It\u2019s beautiful.\n         * It does solar damage.\n         * It makes enemies explode.\n         * It\u2019s Sunshot.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;At this time, Lightweight (150 ROF) Hand Cannons represent the majority of Hand Cannon usage in the Crucible. While we experimented with many different ways to even out Lightweights (150 ROF) and Adaptives (140 ROF), Lightweight Hand Cannons consistently retained a faster time to kill (TTK). As such, we opted to equalize their ROF.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We selected 140 ROF as it is fairly balanced in the Crucible sandbox. It gives other weapon archetypes more time to breath between shots, avoids an overabundance of Hand Cannons with faster TTK than other weapons, and pairs nicely with upcoming changes to 600 ROF Auto Rifles (more on that below).\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sniper Rifles:**\u00a0We want Sniper Rifles to feel powerful, without being so easy to use that they dominate.\u00a0\n\n\n* Adjusted how aim assist (AA) is affected by Sniper Rifle zoom level. Lower zoom scopes have less AA, higher zoom scopes have more, scopes with around 50 zoom are unchanged.\u00a0\n\n\n   * Lowest-zoom scopes have a large reduction in AA cone angle.\u00a0\n   * Highest-zoom scopes have a small increase.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Auto Rifles:** In Season of the Worthy, the Adaptive archetype (600 RoF) was given a buff. We\u2019re pulling that back a little to keep it in check with other Auto Rifle archetypes.\u00a0\n\n\n* Adaptive\u00a0\n\n   * Damage per bullet reduced from 15.75 to 14.25.\u00a0\n   * Note: Prior to Season of the Worthy, damage per bullet was 13.75.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Scout Rifles:** Scouts have a reasonable time to kill (TTK)and can't be adjusted too much without making them dominate the battlefield, so we're making them a little easier to use.\u00a0\n\n\n* Increased how much each point of the AA stat widens the AA cone.\n* At maximum, the AA cone is now 15 percent wider.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Rocket Launchers:** These Heavy weapons currently have very low reserves, so we're adjusting that. We expect to take another look at Rocket Launchers in a future Season.\u00a0\n\n\n* Increased reserves by 1 or 2 rockets depending on Inventory stat.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**General:** The following is a list of surgical changes for select weapons based on player feedback. Some of these changes apply to weapons that are a little too far ahead of other options while others apply small buffs to increase the weapon's effectiveness.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Perks\u00a0\n\n\n   * Outlaw - The reload speed increase felt insufficient with certain subfamilies and combinations of rolls (e.g. Aggressive Hand Cannons).\u00a0\n\n\n      * Increased reload stat bonus from +50 to +70.\u00a0\n\n\n* Merciless\u00a0\n\n\n   * Increased inventory stat from 36 to 55 (this increases reserve ammo).\u00a0\n\n\n* Mountaintop\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n   * We've had a ton of feedback that Mountaintop feels a bit over the top in Crucible modes. This Pinnacle weapon has had ample time to shine, so we\u2019re taking it down a notch.\u00a0\n   * Specific pain points:\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n      * A one-shot body shot with infinite range.\u00a0\n      * Quick and easy cleanup of wounded Guardians, even around corners.\u00a0\n      * Deals high splash damage, rewarding players for inaccuracy.\u00a0\n      * Perfect in-air accuracy allows airborne Guardians to rain down death, and there\u2019s not much grounded Guardians can do to respond.\u00a0\n   * Here are the changes intended to address those points:\u00a0\n\n\n      * Reduced splash damage by 33 percent, increased impact damage such that total damage is 5 percent lower than before.\u00a0\n      * Reduced projectile velocity multiplier from the Micro-Missile perk from 1.4 to 1.2. (i.e., now 20 percent faster than other breech Grenade Launchers instead of 40 percent).\u00a0\n      * Reduced in-air accuracy. Now has significant projectile error while in-air (around 7 degrees without the Icarus Grip mod, substantially less with).\u00a0\n\n\n* Falling Guillotine\u00a0\n\n\n   * Reduced heavy attack damage by ~24 percent to bring in line with other Swords.\u00a0\n   * Note: Falling Guillotine will continue to be slightly above average, just not to the extent that it is now.\u00a0\n\n\n* MIDA Multi-Tool and MIDA Mini-Tool\n\n\n   * MIDA Mini-Tool\n\n\n      * Moved the \"Mida Synergy\" trait to the intrinsic, similar to how the (Baroque) version works\n      * Added the following perks:\n\n\n         * Hip-Fire Grip\n         * Kill Clip\n      * NOTE: There is an issue with the masterwork on this weapon that prevents it from being upgraded. This will be fixed in a later update.\n\n\n* Sturm and Drang\n\n\n   * Drang\n\n\n      * Moved the \"Together Forever\" trait to the intrinsic, similar to how the (Baroque) version works\n      * Added the following perks:\n\n\n         * Accurized Rounds\n         * Moving Target\n      * NOTE: There is an issue with the masterwork on this weapon that prevents it from being upgraded. This will be fixed in a later update.\n\n\n* Ruinous Effigy\n\n\n   * Transmutation Spheres\n\n\n      * Reduced the damage of the aerial melee attack by 25%\n      * Significantly reduced the damage of the drain effect on enemy combatants\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Arbalest\n\n\n   * No longer strikes shields multiple times, but its efficacy against shielded targets has been increased.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Jade Rabbit\n\n\n   * Armor Piercing Rounds swapped to High Caliber Rounds.\n   * This fixes an issue that could prevent the exotic perk from triggering.\n\n\nSome of these changes look pretty hefty, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing your reactions. When first hearing that Aggressive Hand Cannons would be shifted to120 RPM, I wondered if it would be enough to push them into the hands of my Guardian. I can safely say after quite a few playtests, I have a bunch of new favorite Hand Cannons that have been waiting for their time to shine.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s look to some new hotness coming soon to a Lighthouse near you.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##(ADEPT)\u00a0\n\nBefore we let our friends on the Development Team go, we have a few more details concerning weapons to share with you. A few months back, we announced the return of Adept weapons to the Trials experience. Today, we\u2019ll be spending some time getting you reacquainted with these tools of destruction, and how we\u2019re laying the groundwork for future Adept weaponry. While these weapons are similar in name to the Adepts of Destiny 1, there are some added elements to embrace the weapon systems of Destiny 2. With that, we pass the mic back to the Development Team to give you a full rundown:\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev Team:** Beginning in Beyond Light, all existing Trials weapons have Adept versions. Our intent is for all new Trials weapons to have an Adept version in the future, with their infusion caps matching the Season they were introduced in. For our first round of Adepts, their infusion caps will be set to that of Season of the Worthy. Additionally, we will be introducing Adept weapon mods into the sandbox in Beyond Light, which can only be applied to Adept weaponry.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Adept Weapons\u00a0**\n\n\n* Here\u2019s how Adept weapons differ from the base weapons:\u00a0\n\n\n   * Masterworking an Adept weapon grants additional stats.\u00a0\n\n\n      * +10 for the primary stat as usual (the specific Masterwork of the weapon).\u00a0\n      * +3 for all alternate stats.\u00a0\n   * Adept weapons can use either a standard weapon mod or a new Adept weapon mod earned when going Flawless.\u00a0\n\n\n      * A unique Adept shader has been made for these weapons.\u00a0\n      * Note: These shaders are not awarded as a consumable when dismantling an Adept weapon. As such, they cannot be applied to other pieces of gear.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/143/143183/Adept-Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7uQ8puD.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Adept Weapon Mods\u00a0**\n\n\n* These mods come in two varieties:\u00a0\n\n\n   * Weapon stat boosts, each of which grants +10 to a particular stat in a similar way to Masterwork stats.\u00a0\n\n\n      * Example: Adept range (+10 range).\u00a0\n   * Versions of some existing mods granting an improved bonus, but with a downside (base version of the mod explained below).\u00a0\n\n\n      * Adept mag (+40 magazine, -20 handling).\u00a0\n      * Backup mag is +30 magazine.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Acquisition\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;To earn Adept weapons and Adept weapon mods, players must complete a Flawless Trials Passage and open the Flawless chest at the Lighthouse.\u00a0\n\n\n* Each week, a different Adept mod can drop from the Flawless chest.\u00a0\n\n\n   * Adept weapon mods will be on a weekly rotation, so a given mod may not make its appearance until later in the Season.\u00a0\n   * The mod is unlocked for use on owned Adept weapons when acquired.\u00a0\n* Adept weapons will be available from the Flawless chest on a bi-weekly basis, alternating with armor drops.\u00a0\n\n\n   * The first Adept weapon acquired on a given week is a Pinnacle drop.\u00a0\n   * Adept weapons will be on a set rotation, so players may continue to earn alternate rolls on specific Adept weapons when completing Flawless passages throughout a given weekend.\u00a0\n\n\nAs you can see, for those who reach the Lighthouse, your loot is about to get a little more spicy. While Adept rewards are coming first, we also have a Trials armor refresh planned for a future Season, after the stardust has settled from Beyond Light.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWith that, we come to an end to our sandbox previews leading up to Beyond Light. Some of you may be asking, \u201cWait a minute, what about abilities?\u201d In three short weeks, the abilities you\u2019ve come to know and master will be challenged by the Darkness. Stasis will make its debut, bringing a new flavor of combat to the sandbox. The team will be watching closely as you embark on your first strikes, Gambit matches, and Crucible exercises to see how your abilities stack up against each other. It\u2019s going to be a wild time, and we\u2019re excited to see the Light clash with the Dark.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Prime Time Continues\u00a0\n\nThis week saw another update to our Prime rewards. If you have a Prime account, make sure it\u2019s [linked with your Bungie.net account](https://gaming.amazon.com/loot/destiny2)!

Stay tuned for future updates!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Cipher Search\u00a0\n\nFestival of the Lost has reached its halfway mark, and Destiny Player Support is keeping an eye out for scary bugs as we approach the final days of the event. While no major issues have been found, we do have a few reminders on items to complete, and a note on the Interference: Loop Triumph.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**INTERFERENCE: LOOP TRIUMPH\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Due to the extension of Season of Arrivals, the Nokris encounter for the Interference weekly quest will remain for the remainder of the season. This means players who have missed a previous Interference encounter will be unable to access those encounters and will be unable to claim the \u201cInterference: Loop\u201d triumph.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**TITLES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With the start of Year 4 on November 10, certain Seals and their associated Titles will no longer be available to earn.

While watching my own clips from the Crucible can be scary (how can someone be that bad!?), I\u2019m looking for things that are slow burn. Half the movie spent setting the world up, introducing you to characters, then BAM. Weird stuff happening. Lights going out. Doors being mysteriously locked. People turning on each other while trying to do simple tasks to get the space station running. Mentions of *suspicious* behavior. Vents. Garbage disposals. That weird thing where you have to tap a button while disks spin.\u00a0\n\n\nWait, that\u2019s not a movie\u2026 ah well. Let\u2019s get back on topic. While these movies aren\u2019t so scary, they are entertaining! Let\u2019s check out who won MOTW.\u00a0\n\n\n**MOTW: Kingdom Come\u00a0**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/CpU4KCUYV9I)\n\n\n**MOTW: Most of you are too young to understand this reference\u00a0**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/ro_zKeh3ays)\n\n\n**MOTW: Regent\u00a0**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/IwK7GctiPow)\n\n\nFor every movie you see listed here, there\u2019s at least one emblem being granted to those who created them. Want a shot at a sweet emblem? Submit your movie to the [Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) on Bungie.net. We have an expert panel of casual movie watchers selecting things at complete random to win!\u00a0\n\n\nI mean, Cozmo and I watch movies and feature the ones that look fun, cool, unique, or otherwise silly. Sometimes people send us emails with cool videos too. Either way, [take a shot](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations)!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe days are continuing to grow shorter here in Seattle. Pretty soon, Destiny won\u2019t be the only thing enveloped in Darkness. I for one can\u2019t wait. Only two more TWABs stand between you and Europa.\u00a0\n\n\nAh, and before we go \u2013 we've been seeing a lot of questions in the wild on how bounties, currencies, and progression systems will be updated in Beyond Light. We\u2019re currently working to get the info together and making sure everything is factual. This isn\u2019t a \u201cpreppers guide to the galaxy,\u201d mind you. Just a heads up on how these systems are changing. Our current plan is to cover those topics next week! The most frequent question we\u2019re seeing right now concerns bounties, and whether they\u2019ll be cleared at the start of next Season.\u00a0\n\n\nMost of your bounties will stay intact, but any bounties tied to specific Seasonal activities or content entering the DCV will be removed on November 10. Examples would include Black Armory, Gambit Prime, or Festival of the Lost bounties. Additionally, any bounties that grant progression towards Infamy/Valor may negatively impact your powerful rewards, as they will be limited to Season of Arrivals Power Levels. Our recommendation is to go ahead and claim your bounties, just to make sure you don\u2019t miss out on any XP or Glimmer.\n\n\nMore to come next week. See you then.\u00a0\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers":

shot for the next race to World First.\u00a0\n\n\nDestiny 2: Beyond Light is about a month away from launch. For us, this means closing out the game and getting ready to hand it off to you - with a few more fun social media moments to unveil along the way. For you, this means a final stretch of anticipating the new story and the new world you\u2019ll experience as you aim down the barrel of your weapon of choice.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the elite raiders in the room, this means a new shot at glory. The race to a World First completion of a raid is one of the most spirited traditions in the Destiny community. Race Day is when the world turns its eyes to Destiny to see who emerges as the hero. We have stood next to some of those legends on a stage while they claimed their titles in front of a cheering crowd. It\u2019s almost time to fire that starting pistol again.\u00a0\n\n\n**The next race for raid World First begins on Saturday, November 21 at 10 a.m. Pacific.\u00a0**\n\n\nThat should give you plenty of time to get ready. We see you assembling your fireteams and conspiring how to power your way up to a competitive level. We hear you asking when you should \u201ccall in sick.\u201d Now you know, so get to finalizing your plans.\u00a0\n\n\nHere is what else you\u2019ll need to know:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Contest Mode will cap all players at 20 Power below each encounter for 24 hours.\u00a0\n* Artifact Power will **be disabled** during Contest Mode.\u00a0\n* 1230 Power is your team\u2019s goal to be at the cap for all the encounters.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n   * Being above 1230 will **not** provide any additional advantage in the final fight.\n\n\nThis year, the ritual for naming the winners will be different. Following all the immediate fanfare and bustle that follows the checkered flag, our data scientists will be spending extra time validating the finishing team's run. Expect the official announcement for \u201cWorld First\u201d to come a bit later than usual. Disqualifications can happen as per [the official rules](https://www.bungie.net/en/help/article/47218). So finish strong, even if you hear rumors of another team\u2019s victory.\u00a0\n\n\nAn award ceremony will take place in the days that follow the raid. We\u2019ll crown the champions who return first to orbit after a respectable effort. Once we validate a mission completion, we\u2019ll enter their names into history. Every member of the six-player fireteam who is certified as the World First finishers will receive a title belt as their ultimate reward. We will unveil the new belt closer to the start of the race.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nEven if you don\u2019t win World First honors, the earliest victors in the raid can claim some awesome rewards to let the world know you were among the first to fight. Everyone who has completed the raid in the first 24 hours while Contest Mode is activated will receive this very special emblem.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142818/Raid_Emblem5.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jyTAfO5.jpg)\n\n\nFor those of you who want to flex in style, we will be offering a new, Europa-ready raid jacket you can purchase through Bungie Rewards. Finish the raid before December 1 at 9 a.m. Pacific to claim your code. You can use that code to make your purchase any time before 11:59 p.m. Pacific on December 31. We'll show off a preview of the jacket closer to the launch of the raid.\u00a0\n\n\nFor those who like to savor new content like a fine wine and not rush through to the raid experience, you will have rewards waiting on you when you get there. Along with the [redacted] weapons and armor, everyone who completes the raid will earn this emblem.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142818/Raid_Emblem4.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rVSwqSI.png)\n\n\nGood luck to everyone with their sights set on the final boss!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Starside - The Next Generation\u00a0\n\n\nEarlier today, [we announced how Destiny will perform on your next generation console devices.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49650) If you have a pre-order in hand, we want to set expectations for when the full suite of next-gen enhancements to the Destiny player experience will land. These upgrades will be delivered on December 8. Here is a preview of what you can look forward to if you\u2019ll be one of the first to install a shiny new deck in your entertainment center.\u00a0\n\n\n**Feature**|**Xbox Series X**|PlayStation 5|Xbox Series S|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\nResolution|4K|4K|1080p|\nFramerate|60fps|60fps|60fps|\nField of View Slider|Yes|Yes|Yes|\nFaster Load Times|Yes|Yes|Yes|\nCross-Generation Play|Yes|Yes|Yes|\nNext-Generation Upgrade Free|Xbox Smart Delivery|Yes|Xbox Smart Delivery|\n\n\n[Check out the article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49650) for the full explanation. There is more to know about the finer technical details.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##The Key To Celebration\n\nEver since the Festival of the Lost began, we\u2019ve heard your feedback about the scarcity of the Cipher Keys loud and clear. Last week, we deployed some changes to improve upon the situation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;We\u2019ve deployed a fix that will drastically increase Cipher Decoder drop rates from completing activities throughout the game. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation to determine if further fixes are necessary.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players may need to restart their game to receive the update.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) [October 8, 2020](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1314265928293466112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n\n&gt;We\u2019ve further adjusted drop rates for Cipher Decoders so that two drop per activity completion when applicable. We\u2019ll continue to monitor feedback over the weekend. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Please note, Ciphers do NOT drop from the following: enemy kills, Gambit, Forges, and non-playlist Strikes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) [October 10, 2020](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1314717668981710849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n\nSince these changes went live, we\u2019ve seen many Guardians claiming their mummified Ghost, ship, and Sparrow from Eva Levante in the Tower. With candy raining down from your defeated enemies and Ciphers doled out after completed activities, we hope this event feels much more rewarding.\u00a0\n\n\nFestival of the Lost [Bungie Rewards](https://www.bungie.net/en/profile/rewards) are also a bit more accessible, even to those who see themselves as casual gamers in the realm of Destiny. Complete the introductory quest and redeem 15 Ciphers to unlock the Shadehallow Emblem and Restless Ghost Shell Pin on your Bungie Rewards page.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142264/FOTL_Emblem_TWAB_2020-10-01.jpg)\n\n\nThank you to all who sounded off at the beginning of the event. We\u2019re continuing to watch the conversation as it evolves, and hope you\u2019re enjoying the event since the changes went live.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patrons of the Arts\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that the [Bungie Store Community Artist Series](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49121) is back! There are so many amazing artists in the ranks of the Guardians. From time to time, we select a few of them to partner with us in creating some loot you can collect in real life. Check out the creative people who are being featured this round.\u00a0\n\n\n**Clinton Felker: \u201cGhastly Guardians\u201d\u00a0**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142818/CP_Felker_Poster.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LqnlvPF.jpg)\n\n\nI got started in art at a very young age in the Philippines. We didn\u2019t have much back then so creating things like drawing, sculpting, or constructing kept us entertained. My favorite projects to work on are group-based concept projects. I love bouncing ideas off like-minded people and creating something amazing together. I love working with either traditional or digital tools. I embrace them both. I have aspirations to retire back in the Philippines. That is my goal. Going back to where it all started. My art is a stepping stone to that goal. One thing I love about Destiny is the community. There are a lot of good people doing good things.\u00a0 They inspire me to create and share.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**John Sirmon: \u201cCult of Nokris\u201d\u00a0**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142818/CP_Pherian_Shirt.jpg)\n\n\nMy name is John, also known as Pherian online, and I\u2019ve been creating art since I could hold a crayon. I actually put art on hold for more than a decade after college but picked up the pencil again after seeing the first bits of concept art for Destiny. The mixture of genres, the complimentary stylistic choices, and the character designs really reignited my passion for art. I have been drawing peoples\u2019 Guardians ever since the game came out. When I\u2019m not at work or drawing I can generally be found playing video games, reading a good graphic novel, or coaching my kids in sports. Thanks for the chance to be a part of your lives!\u00a0\n\n\n**Brandon McCamey: \u201cBlade in the Dark\u201d\u00a0**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142818/CP_Gammatrap_Poster.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/V4dfmGG.jpg)\n\n\nHi! I'm Gammatrap and I've been an artist in the Destiny community since D1 drawing art based on the lore and stories for Myelin Games. I've spent the better part of the last five years learning and practicing various styles so that I can be as flexible as possible in order to tell these stories. Along with making art for the community I also like to go to the D2 directory on Twitch, start from the lowest view count, and look for newer streamers and surprise them with free art or graphic assets they might need for their streams to help encourage them because I like seeing people grow.\u00a0\n\n\n[These items are live in the store right now.](https://bungiestore.com/collections/community-artist-series) Remember, when you help yourself to these offerings, you are supporting these excellent artists from our community.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Doing Their Part\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/s8wBZpz.gif)\n\n\nWhen the Community Team gathers, it\u2019s the Player Support Specialists who are the smartest people in the room.

Our solar system depends on them.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###CIPHER DECODERS\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Last week we introduced [two fixes](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1314717668981710849?s=20) to increase the drop rates of Cipher Decoders upon activity completions. Players should note that these fixes will not provide an increase in Cipher Decoder drop rates from the following:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Enemy kills\u00a0\n&gt;* Gambit Matches\u00a0\n&gt;* Forge Completions\u00a0\n&gt;* Non-playlist Strikes\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who continue to observe issues with Cipher Decoder drops should report to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help&amp;tSort=0&amp;tType=0&amp;d=2&amp;lang=en).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###END OF THE SEASON PREPARATION\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We are updating the end of the in-game Season timer to reflect that Season of Arrivals will conclude at 7\u00a0 p.m. Pacific on Nov 9 [0300 UTC Nov 10].

I was starry-eyed, terrified, and in no way prepared for the triumphs and trials that awaited us all. Fast forward to now, past dozens of events, hundreds of deployments, thousands of patch notes, and millions of spent shell casings from my Suros Regime\u2026\n\n\nMy last day at Bungie will be November 6, 2020, thus closing out a full nine years in the service of the player. It has truly been an honor. I\u2019ll never forget having the chance to see this community come together and create its own movement. The next destination on my professional journey lies down another path, but I\u2019ll always enjoy retracing the steps we\u2019ve taken together.\n\n\nI\u2019ve made a lot of stops in a career that has spanned many different lives. One of my earliest mentors gifted me some wisdom that has proven true time and time again. \u201cAlways be engineering yourself out of a job and replace yourself with someone better\u201d he insisted. \u201cThe truest measure of success is building something that can thrive in your absence.\u201d\n\n\nBungie has been a very special place where I could do just that. The teams that I\u2019ve had the privilege to work with will carry the conversation forward from here, as they have for years now. They are a fine group of people who care about you as much as the awesome developers who work so tirelessly to create these worlds that we explore together. In so many ways, the Community Managers who are here to succeed me are better than I ever was at anticipating your curiosities. Stick close to them and they\u2019ll keep treating you like the heroes that you are.\n\n\nI\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m leaving Bungie even more a fan than when I arrived those nine years ago. Whoever warned that you should never meet your heroes didn\u2019t have the chance to work in a place like this. I\u2019m taking with me a lifetime of incredible memories of Guardians I would have never known otherwise. Destiny will continue to be an amazing game, in part, because of you. The people who play Bungie games together are the pride and joy of this company. It has been my pleasure to keep our community traditions strong during my time up front.\n\n\nLet us not say goodbye, my friends. Beyond Light is an experience that I\u2019ll share in with each of you. You\u2019ll still see me around for the weeks leading up to the launch, and then I\u2019ll be reverting back to my original role as a passionate member of this community. See you on Europa.\n\n\nThank you for everything! And please do be excellent to each other.\n\n\n**DeeJ, out.**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w",

tooth\u2026 for loot!\u00a0\n\n\n*Boo!\u00a0*\n\n\nDid I scare you? Probably not. But hey, it\u2019s Festival of the Lost! Things are feeling a bit spookier than usual. I can\u2019t take a turn in the Tower without running into a Guardian dressed for the occasion. Eva Levante has returned, masks and all! If you missed the rundown on our spooky seasonal event last week, be sure to read [last week\u2019s blog article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49612).\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142720/d2_fotl_screenshot_5.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/60MGCQQ.jpg)\n\n\nTuesday kicked off the Festival of the Lost, but we\u2019ve also unveiled a few treats that will be coming your way in November. Beyond Light is opening the doors to Europa and renewing your quest for sweet, precious loot! In case you missed it, check out our [Weapons and Gear page on Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/BeyondLight/Gear?ciid=48001), and the trailer below.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/HxNYAtoKPo4)\n\n\nWait a second, we\u2019re giving Warlocks what? Gauntlets that spread poison through hordes of enemies?! I want some! The ability to shift using Mask of Bakris looks pretty sweet for Hunters. In just a little over a month you may find your new favorite Exotic in the wild!\u00a0\n\n\nToday, we\u2019ve got a lot to cover including changes coming to armor mods, the kickoff of our Festival of the Lost Art and Fashion shows, and more! Let\u2019s get started where it all began, in the Cosmodrome.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Burn Bright, New Light\u00a0\n\nOver the last year, there\u2019s been a lot of great feedback about the new player experience in Destiny 2. Currently, players are given a single mission to become acquainted with some basic gameplay, and then let loose in the Tower without much direction\u202fon where to go or what to do next. This led to some confusion, as many players didn\u2019t exactly know where to start.\u202fWho\u2019s that robot that\u2019s meticulously cleaning an Auto Rifle? What\u202fdo I do with\u202fthese engrams?\u202fAnd what\u2019s a\u202fZavala? The team has been working to restructure the onramp for Destiny 2, and today we\u2019ll be giving a small glimpse into the New Light experience.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142720/JJ_Steppes01.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rma4Os2.jpg)\n\n\nStarting November 10, players will start in the same way that most all of us have. A Ghost will be on the hunt for their Guardian, they\u2019ll stumble upon you, and they\u2019ll revive you for the first time. What\u2019s different now is that you won\u2019t immediately find a ship. Rather, you\u2019ll stumble into another Guardian in the wild.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142720/JJ_Shaw02.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nfvO1fl.jpg)\n\n\u202f\u00a0\n\nShaw Han is his name, and he\u2019s on a mission with his fireteam to investigate what the Hive are up to in the Cosmodrome. He\u2019ll show you the ropes, and help you find your way among the gameplay and systems of Destiny 2.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a new player, you\u2019ll spend your first few missions getting acquainted with the state of the world in Destiny 2. You\u2019ll have opportunity to take a few weapons out for a spin, find\u00a0 engrams to try different armor and see our progression systems, and have some time to learn how to navigate the user interface to understand quests, bounties, collections, and more. All of this will happen before you set foot in the Tower, and our hope is that this refreshed New Light experience will give a much warmer welcome to Guardians as they play Destiny 2 for the first time.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142720/JJ_ForgottenShore01.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Pwa9gTl.jpg)\n\n\nWith the Cosmodrome coming\u202fout of the Destiny Content Vault (DCV), this gave us the perfect opportunity to overhaul our new player experience. For veteran players out there, this will be a stroll through memory lane. While the\u202fPlaguelands\u202fare strictly quarantined per Vanguard orders, you\u2019ll still be able to explore much of what you remember from your first days as a Guardian. Running through the\u202fMothyards\u202fto collect\u202fSpinmetal, heading down the stairs of the Steppes to face off against powerful Hive Knights, and more. There will be occasional moments of discovery, like stumbling upon a Lost Sector that you haven\u2019t seen before. If you\u2019re an existing player and would like to go through the New Light quest, it will also be available to you on November 10.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re excited to see how new players react to our revamped New Light experience, and for many of you to get your boots back on the ground in the Cosmodrome.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u00a0\n\nEyes up, Guardian.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Mod Modifications\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re a little over a month out from Beyond Light. Thirty-three days, to be precise. We have quite a bit to cover between now and then, from sandbox updates to how your various economies are being updated. Sandbox is always a hot topic of discussion, and today we\u2019ll be diving a bit deeper into the ways you customize your gameplay experience through armor mods.\u00a0\n\n\nArmor mods are used to elevate your reload speeds, ability regen, and more to higher levels. In November, some of the mods you commonly use are being tuned. Some mods will be buffed, while others will be removed all together. Here, we\u2019re going to dive into a patch note preview of sorts, with snippets of developer commentary from the development team throughout.\u00a0\n\n\n**Energy Type Requirements**\n\n\n* All of the weapon-oriented armor mods (i.e. Hand Cannon Loader, Fusion Rifle Ammo Finder, etc.) have been changed to be Any Energy Type.\u00a0\n\n\n   * As a result of the above change, all Arc Charged with Light mods now activate their second perk if you have any other Arc mod equipped on the same armor piece, OR if you have any other Arc Charged with Light mod socketed in any other armor piece you are wearing.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Developer Commentary:** Removing the energy type requirements from weapon-focused mods has been a consistent piece of community feedback since Armor 2.0 launched. However, doing so meant that every mod socket would be displaying three times as many mods at a time, which would become cumbersome.\u00a0\n\n\n**Enhanced Mod Rebalancing\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* All mods that have an Enhanced version of that mod (i.e. Enhanced Hand Cannon Loader) have had the base mods\u2019 efficacy increased to match that of the Enhanced version of the mod.\u00a0\n\n\n   * As a result, those Enhanced mods have been deprecated, and the base mods\u2019 energy costs have been adjusted upward slightly (but are still lower than the equivalent Enhanced mods).\u00a0\n* Some mods have moved to different slots to create more competition for mod sockets across armor pieces (for example, the Fast Ready mods have moved to the Arms socket).\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Developer Commentary:** We consistently see feedback that players often don\u2019t start feeling the impact of mods until they have an Enhanced mod, or two non-Enhanced mods, socketed. So, to resolve both issues, we decided to raise the floor on the effectiveness of all mods to the point where players were more likely to feel their impact,and to deprecate the two tiers of mods. This should also make having two different mods in the same category (say, Hand Cannon Loader and Shotgun Loader) socketed at the same time more appealing than it was previously, where players often needed to double-stack the same mod to feel like they are getting any benefit.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In essence, we are making Enhanced mods cheaper and more accessible, and deprecating the lesser mods.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Raid Mods\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Starting in Season 12, the Last Wish, Garden of Salvation, and the upcoming Beyond Light raid armors will now drop with a fifth, dedicated armor mod socket that is exclusively for the mods related to that raid.\u00a0\n\n\n   * Last Wish and Garden of Salvation armor acquired prior to Season 12 will not have this dedicated armor socket, but will still be able to use the mods related to that raid in the new Legacy armor mod socket.\u00a0\n* Anti-Taken mods from Last Wish will only function in the Last Wish raid.\u00a0\n* Anti-Hive mods from the Leviathan Raid will be deprecated.\u00a0\n* Anti-Fallen raid mods from Scourge of the Past will be deprecated.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Developer Commentary:** The decision to give the raid armors a fifth mod socket, dedicated solely to its raid mods, should not only make the raid armors a more valuable reward, but also should compensate for the restriction on the usage of these raid mods with the ability to use that armor to craft your build both in and out of the raid.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Regarding the deprecation of the anti-Hive and anti-Fallen mods, and the restriction of the anti-Taken mods to Last Wish, this is something that we\u2019ve had our eye on for a while. We consistently get feedback that\u00a0 faction-specific mods are highly unbalanced outside of the content they were intended to work in (in this case, the raids, which are being moved into the DCV). Because these are useful with any instance of a combatant race, activity designers and sandbox designers were constantly having to be aware of how these mods would impact the play of those activities. They have proven to be problematic in Gambit (creating a clear divide between the Haves and the Have-Nots) and have significantly reduced the challenge of dungeons.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With the raids that provided the source for these mods going into the DCV provides, we have the opportunity to gracefully remove these mods and their long-reaching consequences. Last Wish, which was designed and balanced with its anti-Taken mods in mind, will remain a part of the game and continue to reward players with its mods. However, to prevent those far-reaching consequences mentioned above, we are aligning those mods with the other raid mods and making them function only in the raid that they drop from. We\u2019ve had a positive response to the more mechanic-focused mods from Garden of Salvation, and future raids will have mods more like those.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Combat Mods\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* All armor released in Beyond Light and Season 12, all Last Wish and Garden of Salvation armor acquired starting in Season 12, and all Armor 2.0 Exotic armor pieces (including those already possessed by players) will have a Combat style mod socket. In Season 12, this socket will accept all Charged with Light and Warmind Cell mods.\u00a0\u00a0\n* All Armor 2.0 armor acquired during Seasons 8-11 have had their Seasonal mod sockets replaced with a single, unified Legacy mod socket that can socket all Charged with Light mods, all Warmind Cell mods, all Nightmare Hunt mods, all Garden of Salvation mods, and all Last Wish mods.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd with that, we\u2019ve come to an end for our armor mod patch note preview. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll shift focus to your arsenal. We have a handful of weapon archetypes that are being tuned, with some hefty changes that may surprise you! Stay tuned.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Festival of the Lost - Art and Fashion Shows!\u00a0\n\nThis community is home to wide ranging talent. We\u2019ve seen full on Cabal cosplays at PAX, works of art created on oil and canvas, and some amazing screenshots taken throughout our solar system. With Festival of the Lost in full swing, we\u2019d like to highlight your skills, and pass out some emblems in the process.\u00a0\n\n\n**#FOTLArtShow\u00a0**\n\nNow, we aren\u2019t going to be too strict on a prompt here, but we\u2019d love to see your takes on spooky themes in the worlds of Destiny. Carve a pumpkin, build out a cosplay, or draw some Festival of the Lost themed art (digital or physical mediums are both awesome!), and tweet your submission using the hashtag #FOTLArtShow. We\u2019ll retweet our favorites from [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie) throughout Festival of the Lost and send you an \"***Aspect of Luminance***\" emblem you can show off to your friends!\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138328/v460.offers.entitlements.emblems.crm.emblem12.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/EKP3TX7.jpg)\n\n\n**#FOTLFashionShow\u00a0**\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be Festival of the Lost without a costume contest of sorts, now would it? Eva Levante has been dishing out some fun masks for you to wear in the wild, and we\u2019d love to see how you\u2019re dressing your Guardians for the occasion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTake a screenshot of your Guardian wearing a Festival of the Lost mask in any activity or at any destination. Be sure to dress your Guardian with armor and shaders to compliment your headwear. Tweet your submission with the hashtag #FOTLFashionShow, and we\u2019ll retweet winners from [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie) through the end of the event. If your shot is selected, we\u2019ll grant you the \"*Levante\u2019s Prize*\" emblem.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138328/Fashion_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ODecABr.jpg)\n\n\nThese will serve as your last chances to get the Aspect of Luminance and Levante\u2019s Prize emblems from Year 3. We may use these emblems as rewards again in the future, but they\u2019ll be on hiatus for a while.\u00a0\n\n\nWithout further ado, get to it! Time\u2019s ticking. Extra points to any submissions that visibly creep us out.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Creepy Crawlies\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TI2L2Uc.gif)\n\nWhile it may be the time of year where people actively decorate their homes in spider webs, we\u2019ll never be too keen on bugs. Destiny Player Support is on the case, ensuring you don\u2019t get tangled on your way to this year\u2019s Festival of the Lost.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**SEASON OF ARRIVALS TITLE\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Due to the Cradle encounter\u2019s weekly rotation, it is possible for players to miss an encounter before the end of Season of Arrivals if they are not already completed; this would also prevent players from earning the Season of Arrivals title. Players who are looking to complete the Season of Arrivals title should ensure they have enough time to complete all associated Triumphs before the end of the season. Players who earn the Season of Arrivals title should claim and equip it to ensure that it isn\u2019t removed at the end of the Season.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**BEYOND LIGHT AND THE END OF SEASON OF ARRIVALS\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To prepare for the release of Beyond Light and Season of [REDACTED] on November 10, 2020, Destiny 2 will need to be taken offline for maintenance. In order to prepare for Update 3.0.0, **Destiny 2 will be taken offline for maintenance at 7 PM PST (Pacific Standard Time) on November 9, 2020, and will remain offline until November 10, 2020, at 10 AM PST.** During this offline period, the game will not be available, and Season of Arrivals items will be made unavailable. Players are strongly urged to finish any Season of Arrivals content or Triumphs before 7 PM on November 9th.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**CLOSING OUT SEASON OF ARRIVALS\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When Season of Arrivals ends at 7 PM PST on November 9, 2020, there will be a number of items, activities, and Triumphs that will no longer be available to players. Some of these items include:\u00a0\n\n\n* The Prophecy Dungeon (which will return in a later Season)\u00a0\n* The Ruinous Effigy quest\u00a0\n* Traveler's Chosen quest\u00a0\n* The Seed of Silver Wings Seasonal Artifact and the player power increase from said artifact\u00a0\n* Unopened Umbral Engrams\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A full list of items being removed at the Season\u2019s end can be found [here](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49298).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**PC MIGRATION\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Since moving to Steam, Destiny 2 players have been able to migrate their characters, licenses, and progress from Battle.net to Steam via a one-time transfer. This transfer process will no longer be available beginning December 1, 2020. **Any Destiny 2 PC players who have not migrated their licenses and content from Battle.net to Steam will no longer be available to do so starting on December 1.** Players in this state are encouraged to start our PC Migration process so they will not lose access to their Destiny 2 licenses and content.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Please note that if a player has progress on Steam and chooses to undergo PC Migration, **any existing content on Steam will be overwritten by migrated Battle.net content. This means that all character and progress data on Steam will be deleted and replaced by the character and progress data from Battle.net. This cannot be undone.\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**KNOWN ISSUES\u00a0\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum:\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* We are aware of an issue where the \"Candy Collected\" emblem tracker isn't tracking 2020 Candy.\u00a0\n* We are investigating an issue where Eris Morn\u2019s dialogue and subtitles are not appearing for Korean players in the final Interference mission.\u00a0\n* We are investigating an issue where Cipher Decoders are not dropping often for players.\u00a0\n* We are aware of an issue where the Masquerader's Helmet has inconsistent Power levels when acquired from Eva.\u00a0\n* We are aware of an issue where gear can sometimes drop at 750 Power from the Haunted Forest chests.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our Known Issues article. Players who observe other issues should report them to our #Help forum.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Please note that Season Pass rewards from Season of the Worthy will be unavailable to claim when Season of Arrivals ends.

When I sit back to watch a two-hour horror film full of terrifying screams and scary themes, I just want to relax. This week, you won\u2019t find any jump scares in our MOTW picks. Rather, you\u2019ll find some killer community content.\u00a0\n\n\n**More Than Just A Dream!\u00a0**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/23jTjaiC2XU)\n\n\n**FotL Trailer \u2013 Guitar Cover\u00a0**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/eovyKRu0K3Y)\n\n\n**Definitely a Titan Main\u00a0**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/yx_HnuLR_Hw)\n\n\nWe\u2019ve only got a few more TWAB\u2019s to earn the Shadowkeep MOTW emblem. Put together your best clips, throw some spicy music on it, and get it on the [Community Creations](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) page! Just make sure to include a link to your Bungie.net profile so we know where to send the emblem.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like the buzz before the launch of a new expansion in Destiny 2. If we were in the office, we\u2019d be feeling electricity in the air at Bungie. Things are getting tied up. We\u2019re taking a magnifying glass to the content, finishing up our final test passes to prepare the next year of Destiny 2 for launch. Even in a world where we\u2019re working remotely, the excitement is felt in each meeting as we dot the I's and cross the t\u2019s. Soon, it will all be in your hands, and we\u2019ll be right there with you as you embark on your first journeys of Europa.\u00a0\n\n\nWe hope you enjoyed a peek at upcoming Exotics earlier this week. We have a lot more for you to see, and a lot more for you to experience, all coming soon. We know many of you are trying to plan some time off for the raid race, and we\u2019re looking to have some details on that next week. Stay tuned.\u00a0\n\n\nCheers,\u00a0\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1810741,

ghosts.\u00a0\n\n\nNext week, we\u2019re getting spooky up in the Tower again. **Festival of the Lost returns on October 6** for more fright-filled fun. This year\u2019s festival is going to rock!\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/jUsz11L8b2k)\n\n\nCheck out our [Festival of the Lost 2020 page](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/FestivalOfTheLost) for a quick look at what to expect during this year\u2019s event.\u00a0\n\n\nEva Levante, or as you all affectionately call her \u201cSpace Grandma,\u201d has returned to the Tower to lead Guardians in a celebration of those we\u2019ve lost. We miss you, Cayde.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Haunted Forest is back and filled with ghoulish enemies. This year, we\u2019ve added five chests to the end of the activity for five times the loot!\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142264/Eva_Tower.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bY4P8us.jpg)\n\n\nTo open the chests, you are going to need some Cipher Decoders. Talk to Spider to get started and then they will drop from playing any of your favorite activities across the solar system - similar to Umbral Engrams. Braytech Werewolf and Horror Story will both be rewarded from these chests and each have new perk combinations to hunt for.\u00a0\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably been hearing this a lot lately, but it goes double for Festival of the Lost: don\u2019t forget to put on your mask. There are new masks available this year as well as some favorites from the past. Eva has a Masquerader Helmet which you can apply your masks to as ornaments before you head out in the world to start stockpiling candy. The mask mods for the Haunted Forest also return from last year\u2019s event.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142264/Masks_Collage.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rK3drjX.jpg)\n\n\nBefore we **wrap up the event on November 3**, you are going to want to complete three of the Triumphs for opening chests in the Haunted Forest. Once you finish off the required Triumphs you will be able to trade in some of your candy for a mummified Exotic Sparrow, ship, and Ghost.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142264/Gear_Sparrow.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mk8lsxx.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142264/Gear_Ship.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kg7X11q.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142264/Gear_Ghost-Shell.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YXkAZfJ.jpg)\n\n\nFinishing the \u201cWrapped and Ready\u201d Triumph required to get the Exotic Ghost also unlocks the ability to purchase the Restless Shell Ghost pin through Bungie Rewards.\u00a0\n\n\nSpeaking of Bungie Rewards, we also have a terrifying new emblem available for free if you finish the initial quest during Festival of the Lost.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142264/FOTL_Emblem_TWAB_2020-10-01.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8sBvnx6.jpg)\n\n\nThat\u2019s the gist of it, but here are a few quick notes that may answer some questions you have:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Minimum Power to enter the Haunted Forest is 750.\u00a0\n* You can hold up to 25 Cipher Decoders before you need to go open some chests in the Haunted Forest.\u00a0\n* There will be both earnable masks and masks available for Silver/Bright Dust.\u00a0\n\n   * Any Triumphs involving masks do not require masks from Eververse.\u00a0\n* Bounties will return from last year and will once again offer Bright Dust.\u00a0\n* All-new Eververse items will be available for both Silver and Bright Dust except for the \u201cOne-Inch Punch\u201d finisher which will be available for Silver.\u00a0\n* The toothbrush is still just a toothbrush.\n\n\n***\n\n\n##Direct Relief\u00a0\n\nIt seems like 2020 has been one disaster after another. It\u2019s easy to get discouraged when times get tough, but the Destiny community always comes together to support those in need.\u00a0\n\n\nHere in the United States, more than 500,000 people having been evacuated from their homes across California, Oregon, and Washington, entire towns devoured by flames, and there has been a serious impact on the respiratory health of millions of individuals in and around these areas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Bungie Foundation is once again supporting the relief efforts of [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/california-wildfires/)  to provide N-95 masks, medicine, and other resources to healthcare agencies and first responders in wildfire-affected communities across California, Oregon, and Washington.\u00a0\n\n\nAll profits from the sale of the [Empathetic Ghost Shell pin](https://bungiestore.com/products/preorder-empathetic-ghost-shell-collectible-pin) from October 1 until October 15 will benefit Direct Relief\u2019s wildfire relief efforts.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you purchase an Empathetic Ghost Shell pin you will also instantly receive a code for the \u201cBenevolent Hue\u201d emblem as a thank you for your support.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/142/142264/Bungie_Rewards_Emblem_TWAB_2020-10-01.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OGrHUVS.jpg)\n\n\nThank you all for continuing to step up to every challenge that this year has sent our way and for truly being the most generous and caring gaming community there is.\u00a0\n\n\n##\n\n***\n\nDouble Ordeal\n\n\nFestival of the Lost is not the only reason to log in next week. Double rewards in Nightfall: The Ordeal is back! Grab a few friends or meet some new ones in the matchmade difficulties. It\u2019s a great time to stock up on Enhancement Prisms and Ascendant Shards for your Masterworking needs as well as to grab any missing Exotics or upgrade to a better stat roll.\u00a0\n\n\nThe strike will be \u201cA Garden World\u201d so watch out for those killer robots.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##PSR BUT IT\u2019S HAUNTED\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1AGzpkg.gif)\n\nNow we turn things over to our Player Support team with the latest on known issues.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Festival of the Lost\n&gt;\n&gt;Festival of the Lost 2020 is set to begin on October 6, and will conclude at the [weekly reset](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46165) on November 3.

Any time it\u2019s socially acceptable to put on a costume and eat sweets until you get a stomachache is a good time. It\u2019s extra fun if you have kids/pets to dress up. Can\u2019t wait to also start dressing up my Hunter next week as well.

changing\u2026\n\n\nYou feel that? The slight chill in the air? It\u2019s time to prepare for a colder climate, Guardians. Europa has no sympathy unprepared guests. You might want to come with a weapon or two, because frigid storms aren\u2019t the only danger to be found here. Don\u2019t be afraid, though. An old friend will be waiting for your arrival.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89GEiE6HaKs)\n\n\nThe weather may be brutal, but that won\u2019t stop you from exploring this frontier. [Take a look at the map of Europa](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/BeyondLight/europa?ciid=48001), and be sure to check out our most recent weather forecast.\n\n\n##**[Europa Report: 100% Chance of Snow](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49582)**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141191/Europa_Storm_04_03Full.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jKPjPjU.jpg)\n\n\nYou now have less than seven weeks to get ready. Don\u2019t get caught out in the cold without a plan. November 10 is coming quick, and we\u2019re eager to see how long you survive.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##It\u2019s a Pass\u2026 for Games!\n\nEarlier this week, Forsaken and Shadowkeep became available on Xbox Game Pass. With Beyond Light on the way, there\u2019s no better time to gear up and get acquainted with what\u2019s going on in the world of Destiny.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141326/GamePass_Forsaken_Shadowkeep.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/f6USwvx.jpg)\n\n\nA few housekeeping notes for Guardians who are being freshly rez\u2019d in the Cosmodrome:\n\n\n\n* You\u2019ll need to download Destiny 2, Forsaken, and Shadowkeep to access this content.\n\n\n   * Without Destiny 2, you can\u2019t launch the game.\n* For new Guardians joining our ranks through Xbox Game Pass, we have a [Help Article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49581) specifically for you.\n\n\n   * Our help forums are also available at any time if you hit a snag on your way to the Tower.\n* If you encounter any issues accessing game content or Xbox related services, please refer to [Xbox Support](https://support.xbox.com/).\n\n\nEyes up, Guardians. Welcome to the community.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Ye Olde Banner of Iron\n\nA few weeks back, we announced the extension of Season of Arrivals, noting that we\u2019d be adding a few fun things between September 22 and the new November 10 launch date of Beyond Light. First, we featured some Double Ordeal loot on Lake of Shadows. This week, Drifter has been upping the ante with Triple Infamy. Next week, Lord Saladin returns with Triple Valor, themed weapons and armor, and his Pinnacle Power bounty rewards.\n\n\nDon\u2019t go in thinking it will be easy to snag some loot, though. Control is the name of the game, and Power is enabled. If you haven\u2019t risen through the Pinnacle band yet, you may find yourself facing a raid boss or two on the other team.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139803/IronBanner_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MmW6ghv.jpg)\n\n\n**Iron Banner**\n\n**Starts: 9/29/2020 10:00 AM PT**\n\n**Ends: 10/6/2020 10:00 AM PT**\n\n\nThere will be a few more weeks with increased rewards for Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit, so stay tuned for announcements!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Talking Tech \u2013 Preparing for Beyond Light\n\nWith Beyond Light on fast approach, it\u2019s time to shift our TWAB gears a little. Today, we\u2019ll be talking through some of the back-end changes that will be coming to Destiny 2 on November 10. To guide us through this process, we\u2019re passing the mic to Destiny Engineering Director David Aldridge.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**DAldridge:**\u00a0 When Destiny 2 launched three years ago, we had no idea that in 2020 we\u2019d announce a new trilogy of expansions (among other 2020 surprises we didn\u2019t anticipate).\u00a0 At the time, we thought Destiny 2\u2019s arc would look a lot more like Destiny 1 \u2013 a couple of expansions, and then a sequel.\u00a0 \u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;We learned many lessons from the transition to Destiny 2, and from shipping Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, the Year-2 Seasons, and Shadowkeep. When we evaluated those lessons, we decided not to pursue a Destiny 3, but instead to reinvest everything in Destiny 2 and make it all that it can be ([check out our longer writeup on this choice here](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49189)). To support that strategy, we\u2019ve made several tech investments to help us sustainably evolve the game for years to come, and some of those investments are arriving in Beyond Light.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Many of these changes are under the hood and won\u2019t affect your experience (except insofar as they help us deliver you more and better Destiny in the future), but some may result in neat improvements, curious behavior differences, or bugs. This means that, on November 10, some places and things will feel a little like *Sliders* (only 90s kids will get this), so we\u2019d like to give you a rundown of some of the changes and possible side effects.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**We shifted our mission scripting model to run on the Physics Host instead of the Mission Host** (more details on this split [here](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/45919), in the interview with Matt Segur). In the long run this change will give designers options to create more novel mission mechanics by giving the mission scripting environment full access to the game state, instead of the much more limited access the Mission Host had. For example, the Physics Host knows exactly where enemy combatants are and what actions they recently performed \u2013 while the Mission Host only knew how many combatants were alive in a squad and what that squad was generally trying to accomplish. In Beyond Light we\u2019re only launching the foundations of this system,\u00a0and we look forward to evolving and leveraging it in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **What you might notice:\u00a0\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * The new scripting environment changed many behaviors in complex ways, and you may see interesting behavior changes or bugs in pre-Beyond-Light missions (and public events, and similar) that were originally built and tested on the previous system.\u00a0 We\u2019ve tested these missions heavily and stamped out many bugs, but some will undoubtedly slip through. We\u2019ll be monitoring and fixing remaining bugs over time. In some cases, these issues were more severe \u2013 for example, they caused the Prophecy dungeon to be unavailable temporarily. We\u2019re all excited for its triumphant return, slated for the end of this year!\n&gt;   * One other cool new feature in this area is face-to-face joins in social spaces, so you can now fireteam up with Tower friends without a long Tower reload!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**We revamped our content building and patching pipeline for speed and install size.** With the tremendous size of Destiny, our complete shippable content builds were frequently taking north of 24 hours. We made investments to bring that down to sub-12 hours, which resulted in a bunch of changes to our content and patching formats. We also took on work to allow us to cull content that we\u2019ve upgraded or replaced \u2013 our previous patching system had limited capabilities here (due to trying to minimize patch sizes and other constraints), and the current Destiny 2 install has a significant amount of accreted \u2018dead\u2019 content (e.g. assets in the base install that were replaced in later patches).\u00a0 \u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **What you might notice:\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Due to all these changes, Beyond Light will be a full re-download on all platforms \u2013 we know this will be painful for those with slower or metered internet connections, and we\u2019re sorry about that. To help mitigate this, we\u2019re planning to enable Beyond Light preloads sometime in the evening of November 9, Pacific Time, which should give everyone at least 10 hours to download before the gates open.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Destiny 2's install size shrinks by 30-40%: Due to a combination of culling unused or replaced content, install size optimizations, and moving some content to the Destiny Content Vault, Destiny 2\u2019s install size will shrink to between 59 and 71GB (depending on platform), a reduction of 30 to 40%. These improvements should also help us control install size better in the coming years.\u00a0 \u00a0\n&gt;   * **We hope to use these much faster builds to accomplish two things:\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * Help us ship mission-critical fixes faster when game-breaking bugs arise.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * Reduce our overall ship pipeline depth, enabling us to work on Destiny releases closer to their ship dates, so we can react to fresher information about what\u2019s happening in the live game. For example, historically each of our Seasons has had to get deep into production before the preceding season launched, preventing us from reacting to learnings from that preceding season. These tech improvements should give us 1-2 more weeks of flexibility on a Seasonal scale, helping us pivot more quickly in some cases.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**We rebuilt our character face system.** We know that how your Guardians look is important to you, and we\u2019ve long wanted to add more player customization to Destiny. Our original system for player faces had some combinatoric content authoring problems \u2013 for example, every decal had to be authored completely custom for each player face permutation. This prevented us from extending this area of the game with more content and features. We\u2019ve upgraded to a significantly more capable system (with e.g. runtime decal projection), which we hope to leverage for more player customization options in the future. As part of this process we reviewed the existing player models with our Diversity Committee and Employee Resource Groups in the studio to make small tweaks to existing player heads. We\u2019re also building a list of Guardian face shapes we should bring to the game in the future in order to increase Guardian diversity in Destiny, with the long-term goal of enabling everyone to imagine themselves as their Guardian.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **What you might notice:**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Your Guardian\u2019s face may look a bit different.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**We relit portions of EDZ and Nessus.** During the early stages of Beyond Light production the Lighting and Skies teams had a desire to provide a visual refresh to the two remaining D2 Year 1 destinations, EDZ and Nessus, as they enter their fourth year in rotation. To that end, the teams performed relights and global lighting updates to a number of locations on both destinations.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **What you might notice:**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Different lighting on existing destinations! The changes are intentional and are meant to bring the visual quality of these spaces up to our current lighting standards, while providing a fresh coat of paint for some of our Year 1 locations. We hope you enjoy these updates to some familiar locations when you explore EDZ and Nessus this November.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re excited to leverage these improvements to redouble our efforts on Destiny 2, and we aim to make Destiny 2 still feel like your home away from home.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks,\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;-David Aldridge\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;P.S. Congratulations on making it to the end of this long and nerdy love letter. If your passion for all things Destiny Tech is not yet spent, you may enjoy the [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/hiw8qt/im_david_aldridge_the_director_of_engineering_for/) that Destiny Engineering Manager\u00a0Chris Kosanovich and I did a couple months ago!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Did You Say\u2026 More Emblems???\n\nBeyond Light isn\u2019t just bringing Europa to the fold. It\u2019s also bringing many, many pieces of loot. This year, we\u2019re refreshing a few Community emblems for you to hunt. Whether it be Fashion, Art, Movie of the Week, or the Bungie Bounty, we have some new swag to hopefully catch your eye. I\u2019m personally giddy that we have seven total Community Emblems to show off. There\u2019s just something about that number that we love so much\u2026\n\n\n**Fashion Show**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141326/Emblem_Fashion.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/T3ECTwv.jpg)\n\n\n**Featured Artist**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141326/Emblem_Artist.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NfK5XUs.jpg)\n\n\n**Movie of the Week**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141326/Emblem_MovieoftheWeek.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sxkCWwr.jpg)\n\n\n**Bungie Bounty**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141326/Emblem_Bounty.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rLlkazX.jpg)\n\n\nShadowkeep variants for each emblem will be available through November 10. There will be a few final chances to earn them before the new hotness becomes available. Stay tuned!\n\n\nWe\u2019d also like to take a moment to celebrate our Community Volunteers. If you\u2019ve ever visited the help forum, you may have noticed some members answering questions and linking players to general help articles and Bungie-authored troubleshooting methods. These are the **Mentors**, the \u201cwhite gloves\u201d of our community, dedicated to lending a helping hand to any player trying to get back into the game.\n\n\nOur Moderators, however, are referred to as **Ninjas**. They work in the shadows, removing bad actors from our forums whenever the Code of Conduct is broken. You may see one every so often in the forums replying to threads, but their work is behind the scenes.\n\n\nAs of late, we\u2019ve also been receiving some help from community moderators during Bungie livestreams. Whether they be Bungie Bounties, charity initiatives, or whatever reason we decide to broadcast, these individuals are helping to keep chat a bit cleaner. Join us in welcoming **Shields** to the fold of our community moderation teams.\n\n\nEach volunteer group will be receiving a new emblem this year. While it might seem like a minor gesture, we hope that you join us in giving them thanks whenever you see these emblems in the wild.\n\n\n**Mentors**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141326/Emblem_Mentor.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rKXAjhX.jpg)\n\n\n**Ninjas**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141326/Emblem_Ninja.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/z8flRJL.jpg)\n\n\n**Shields**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141326/Emblem_StreamMods.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/y3oIy6h.jpg)\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering \u201cHow do I become a volunteer?\u201d, our members are all community sourced. If we see you helping out in the forums frequently or just having a good time in chat while upholding our Code, we may reach out to see if you\u2019d like to join up! That said, don\u2019t do it for the emblem. Do it out of the kindness of your heart and for the betterment of our community. The emblem is just a little treat.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Support Specialists\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hHq9HU5.gif)\n\n\nThis week was a fun one.

Did you credit any fellow creators who appeared in your video? Sweet! We\u2019ll get your emblem to you within a few business days.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nDid you make it this far? Always fun to have a meaty TWAB. I\u2019ll spare you a long outro, but I do want to say this: Thanks for stopping by. We always appreciate those who tune in for the weekly conversation, whether we have a lot of new info, or just a simple check-in to see how everyone\u2019s doing between content drops.\n\n\nFestival of the Lost is on the way.

of your Ghosts.\n\n\nLast week, [a new Exotic became available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPYtfsYr8bA&amp;ab_channel=destinygame) to add to your collection and we [celebrated Destiny\u2019s birthday](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49527). I\u2019m still keeping an eye out for pictures of attempts at making that cake. Things are a little quieter this week. Which makes it a great time to take advantage of the double rewards being offered for completions of The Ordeal this week. You love to see it when a bug becomes a feature.\u00a0\n\n\nSpeaking of upcoming features\u2026\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Customizable Ghosts\n\nA Guardian\u2019s Ghost is their most trusted ally and is tasked with keeping them in the fight. Your Ghost isn\u2019t just in charge of bringing you back from the brink, it also comes with some perks and a wide range of cool looks to choose from. We have some changes planned for your floaty friends and asked **Designer Mina Jasinski** to tell us about what her team is doing to improve how you customize your Ghosts.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Mina Jasinski**: Ghosts have always been important partners to our Guardians in the Destiny universe, but they haven\u2019t received any meaningful updates in quite some time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To allow Ghosts to truly shine as the useful and interesting companions we\u2019d like them to be, we decided it was time to give them a bit of an overhaul.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In Destiny 2: Beyond Light, Ghosts have received a system update which shares some functionality to what was done with armor in Shadowkeep. Here\u2019s a brief outline of what to expect:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Ghost Shells will now have energy levels and access to mods with various energy costs instead of being pre-loaded with specific perks.\n&gt;* This treatment has been applied to all Ghosts outside of the Generalist Shell, so you can use your favorite Ghost Shells, regardless of tier.\n&gt;* A selection of mods will be available on all Ghost Shells by default, while the remaining ones will be obtainable via various gameplay sources. Information on where to find these mods can be learned from Collections.\n&gt;* Ghost mods will be obtained from gameplay reward loops and will not be purchasable from Eververse.\n&gt;* Ghosts now have four mod slots. Three are unlocked by default, and the fourth is unlocked by Masterworking the Ghost Shell.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;One of our goals with this update was to separate visuals from functionality. We wanted any Ghost Shell to be viable and still have access to highly useful mods, regardless of tier or source.\n&gt;\n&gt;You'll be able to select your favorite Ghost Shell based on appearance without any detriment to your experience. Whether you purchase a Ghost Shell from Eververse, earn it from the newest raid or pull an old favorite out of Collections, your Ghost will have access to all the same mods across your account. From there you can increase energy levels on your favorite Ghost Shells and set each of them up with different mod combinations of your choosing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As mentioned above, Ghosts will now have access to a total of four mod slots, each with their own unique mod selection. There will be an Experience mod slot, a Tracking mod slot, an Economic mod slot, and an Activity mod slot; the last of which is unlocked when the Ghost is Masterworked at 10 energy. You\u2019ll be able to mix and match mods from these categories however you like, with respect to energy limits. Mod slots each have a selection of mods that can be combined to fit your playstyle. For example, a Crucible-focused player who wants to grind out materials and earn XP towards their Seasonal rewards track might choose Guiding Light, Meager Glimmer Booster, and Lesser Core Harvest (Crucible). There are a variety of combinations that can be set up on different Ghosts to suit whatever goals you might be chasing at the time!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For those wondering what will happen to the old Ghost perks, most have been brought forward largely unchanged as default unlocked mods. In some cases, such as the destination-specific material or cache trackers, those mods have been transformed into globally effective, non-destination-specific versions of themselves for better utility. Energy costs for those mods now reflect the increased flexibility and the mods must be earned from various vendor engrams. Kill Tracker and Leviathan Boss Kill perks will remain intrinsic only on their specific Ghost Shells. Even with these changes you\u2019ll still be able to build most of the popular Exotic perk combinations that were available previously such as Guiding Light and Treasure Hunter, along with a plethora of new combinations!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We hope that these changes allow you to interact with your Ghost more meaningfully and help you to set up a variety of Ghost Shells that suit you in various playstyles and activities.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141127/Ghost_Mod_XP_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fSVpEMc.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141127/Ghost_Mod_HarvestCore_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/54iGsxu.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Honoring a Friend\n\nNext week, we have a tribute going live in game to honor one of our dear friends at Vicarious Visions who passed away last year, Matt Helsom. The weekly reset will include a director message that will send you to Mars for a short quest to honor Mr. Helsom. He worked closely with teams at both Bungie and VV on various projects during our partnership and we wanted to memorialize his contributions in the Destiny universe.\n\n\nWe wish all of his family, friends, and everyone he impacted during his life the very best. Thank you to everyone in the community who joins us in remembering this warm soul.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##X Marks the Pass\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yt4kCDn.gif)\n\n\nNow we turn things over to our Player Support team with the latest on known issues and upcoming fixes.\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###XBOX GAME PASS AND EXPANSION AVAILABILITY\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Tuesday, September 22, Destiny 2 will become available on Xbox Game Pass at 8 AM PDT, however, players won\u2019t be able to access Forsaken or Shadowkeep until 10 AM PDT when Hotfix 2.9.2.1 goes live.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###HOTFIX 2.9.2.1\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, for next Tuesday, Hotfix 2.9.2.1 will go live.

Our investigation found that trying to fix these issues could result in all Clans losing their earned ranks. These issues will be fixed on Nov. 10 when Beyond Light launches.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Felwinter\u2019s Helm changes the Warlock\u2019s Solstice ornament glows to another glow.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

If you\u2019re planning on it, I recommend not doing it while a huge plume of smoke blankets your area for several days. How is the air where you are? We\u2019re having a bit of \u201chelmet on in the Tower\u201d kind of time here on the West Coast right now.\n\n\nWherever you are, we hope you are doing well and looking forward to the bonus weeks of this Season as we rapidly approach the release on Beyond Light in a few short months.

stacks of Light.\n\n\nWithin Destiny 2, the exodus of Io, Titan, Mercury, and Mars continues. Zavala has tasked you with spreading word of impending Darkness and keeping our beloved vendors up to speed. There are still a few more loose ends to tie up on these destinations, so get to it.\n\n\nAlong your quest, you\u2019ll have some final chances to earn unique loot and fill out your collections before access to various strikes is impeded by the Darkness.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/rPYtfsYr8bA)\n\n\nWhile the Traveler may have chosen you, it\u2019s almost time to go beyond the Light. Don\u2019t forget where you came from, though, as we\u2019re celebrating Destiny\u2019s almost-seventh birthday this week! Yeah, we know, it\u2019s been six years. But seven is darker.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/140/140870/destiny-anniversary-2020-color2_1920x1080_wallpaper.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rb7kxmG.jpg)\n\nIf you haven\u2019t snagged the sweet wallpapers or seen our Stasis deep dives, head on over to our [fresh blog article covering the fun](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49527)! While we're celebrating the past, we're also getting ready for the future.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/D2_BL_Stasis_Infographics_Stasis_1920x1080_EN_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sPocco6.jpg)\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re a veteran of Destiny or have just been rez\u2019d in the Cosmodrome, thank you for playing, and thank you for being a part of our community.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Suit up\n\nA few TWAB\u2019s ago, Luke Smith took some time to run through changes to our philosophy in doling out rewards through the various activities of Destiny 2. [Hit the article again](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49002) if you\u2019d like a refresher on vanity, cosmetics, and more. Today, we\u2019ll be focusing on core playlist rewards (strikes, Gambit, and Crucible).\n\n\nTo quote the article, here\u2019s what you can expect on November 10:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* We are adding a new set of Armor for the core playlists (strikes, Gambit, and Crucible).\u00a0\n* This armor shares a set of new geometry, with decals and shaders specific to the activity.\u00a0\n* We will create new sets like this each Year (e.g., Year 4, Year 5, Year 6, etc.)\n* This set will arrive alongside the next expansion.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/Playlist_Armor.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rsFquh7.jpg)\n\n\nThis armor can be earned by completing activities or through vendor rank-ups. Weekly challenges are also being updated to offer avenues for players to earn higher-stat packages for these armor sets.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, Year 4 will see the return of pursuit weapons. For those of you who may have joined our community in the last Season or two, these weapons have static perks, but allow for some customization. The final two perk columns have multiple perks to choose from, so you can tailor your weapon to your desired playstyle. Our eagle-eyed Guardians may recognize this beauty from a recent Stasis trailer\u2026.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/Adored_Base.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2aKJ0kL.jpg)\n\n\nOur goal is to have a pursuit weapon available per Season, earned through a focused quest. Banshee will give you a choice between Strikes, Crucible, or Gambit to earn the base model. Make sure you take a moment to think about how you want to earn the weapon, as you'll be locked in to specific objectives for whichever activity you pick.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce you finish the main quest, Commander Zavala, Lord Shaxx, and the Drifter will offer you an additional quest which will reward you with weapon ornaments to the theme of their respective activities. If you\u2019re omnivorous and enjoy all three offerings, all three will be available to you.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/Adored_Vanguard.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/twnaCmB.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/Adored_Crucible.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oIOmckn.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/Adored_Gambit.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/f0uqf49.jpg)\n\n\nSo, now that we've caught your eye with some fancy armor and a new sniper, let's take a quick look at how things are changing for core activities as you launch into your new adventures on November 10. Strike, Gambit, and Crucible playlists are being streamlined.\n\n\n**Crucible**\n\nStarting in Season 12, the Director will be updated to reduce the number of playlists available at a given time.\n\n\n* Featured Modes:\n\n\n   * Control\u00a0\n   * Elimination\u00a0\n   * Rumble\u00a0\n   * Survival\u00a0\n\n\n      * Both Survival and Survival: Freelance will be available\n   * Weekly rotator:\u00a0\n\n\n      * Clash, Mayhem, and Showdown\u00a0\n   * Private matches\u00a0\n   * Limited Availability\n\n\n      * Iron Banner\n      * Iron Banner: Freelance will make its debut in Season 12.\u00a0\n\n\n         * Similar to Competitive, this will be a smaller node next to Iron Banner when the playlist is available.\u00a0\n   * Weekend Availability\n\n\n      * Trials of Osiris\u00a0\n      * **Note:** Adept weapons, rewarded to those reaching the Lighthouse, return to Trials of Osiris in Season 12. (More details on functionality to come in a Sandbox preview, currently planned for October.)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/Director_Crucible_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Gtajjbe.jpg)\n\n\n**Strikes**\n\n\n\n* Vanguard strikes and Nightfall: The Ordeal will be your two playlist options.\n\n\n   * Each playlist will continue to offer weekly challenges for Powerful loot.\n   * Nightfall: The Ordeal will continue to feature matchmaking at lower difficulties, and increased rewards for higher difficulty options.\n   * **Note:** We\u2019re also looking to add Adept weapons to strikes in a future Season. We\u2019ll have updates closer to Season 13 on what to expect.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/Director_Vanguard_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hKZS4ty.jpg)\n\n\n**Gambit**\n\nAs covered last week, Gambit and Gambit Prime will be consolidated into a single mode. We have some additional details on specific rule changes, as well as development notes from the team on how things are changing, and the goals behind them.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Gambiteers! We wanted to give you an explanations of rules changes coming to Gambit in November, as well as a key update from last week.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First, some goals we wrote down before we started:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Build a more approachable Gambit Prime, keeping the one-round format with a longer round, but without the Gambit Prime armor perks.\u00a0\n&gt;* Rebalance the motes phase to last 2/3 of each match, rather than half of the match.\n&gt;* Speed up the Primeval fight (compared to Gambit Prime) to give more of the feeling of a \u2018boss rush.\u2019\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We started with the Gambit Prime encounters, full stop. However, without the Reaper buffs, the Large bosses that come in enemy waves were too tanky \u2013 so we pulled them all down to miniboss or elite. The pacing should feel like how Gambit feels for a pickup group, or how Prime feels for a fully kitted team.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We also playtested the \u201chaving the motes\u201d phase target a score of 150, and/or have a heavier mote drain, but this allowed organized teams to steamroll even more effectively \u2013 not less. So, we pulled back to the current Gambit Prime mote target and drain.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We started with the Gambit Prime Blockers, but pulled the Taken Captain from the Blocker lineup, as he proved a little too potent for a 10-mote Blocker. We replaced him with the Phalanx, who can be tough to kill, but not as lethal. Since we don\u2019t have the armor perks, we also had to remove the 20-mote Giant Blocker.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We kept the invasions during mote phases at three \u2013 just like Gambit Prime \u2013 but pulled back the minimum time between invasions during mote phases from 10 seconds to 20 seconds. It never feels good to get invaded back-to-back.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the boss fight, we started with the Gambit Primeval fight, removed the timed Slayer buffs, increased the Primeval health and potency of the slayer buff given by when killing envoys. We respawn the envoys every 40% damage done to the Primeval \u2013 so if you get invaded and the Primeval is healed a lot, you have the opportunity to get more Slayer buffs and catch up. The fight length ends up somewhere in between the original Gambit and Gambit Prime, so we adjusted the invasion timer during the Primeval phase to match \u2013 right in between Gambit and Gambit Prime timing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;So, overall this mode will be a little quicker than Gambit Prime \u2013 mostly due to shortening of the boss phase and the removal of the larger bosses from the fronts, but one that still gives that great Gambit feeling that you all love.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/141/141008/Director_Gambit_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pbGco2g.jpg)\n\n\nWe see you\u2019re hungry for info, and we\u2019re excited to bring the heat. As we approach Beyond Light, we\u2019ll have more details on how your weekly rituals are changing. Economy, Eververse, Sandbox, and more. We\u2019re looking forward to talking about things like solo queue Iron Banner, but we have a few things left to tie up as we approach launch.\n\n\nStay tuned\u2026\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Triumph Trackers\n\nLast week, we announced some changes coming to Triumphs in November. Various Triumphs and Seals will soon become unavailable, leaving you to figure out which things to prioritize before the end of the Season. Partnering with some community API creators, there are now multiple options for you to create a checklist of sorts. Here\u2019s a quick list in no particular order. They\u2019re all amazing, and we hope you find one that suits you best!\n\n\n* [Destiny Item Manager](https://destinyitemmanager.com/)\n* [Light.gg](https://www.light.gg/)\n* [Destiny Tracker](https://destinytracker.com/)\n* [Braytech.org](https://braytech.org/)\n* [D2Checklist.com](https://www.d2checklist.com/)\n\n\nMany thanks to these creators, and we\u2019re excited to see how their portals and communities grow as we begin another year of Destiny content.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##The noble quest to vanquish all bugs\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RHxjJxv.gif)\n\n\nDestiny 2 Update 2.9.2 shipped this Tuesday, and the Player Support team has been prowling the #Help forum in search of fresh bugs to smash. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t look like there are any major issues cropping up!\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**COMPANION APP**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Early last week, Bungie.net and the Destiny API underwent maintenance. As a result of that maintenance, item transfer performance using the Companion App or third-party apps became roughly 10x faster for most players.

No? Well, go grab your Traveler\u2019s Chosen and have a stack! I heard it goes well with popcorn, a soda, and a relaxing MOTW.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Legends Never Die**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/RpLcbyKhoNE)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Thread the Needle**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/38hQJ6MEP_o)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Wait, that\u2019s illegal!**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/hYqBK_8r5Mg)\n\n\nWant a chance at the MOTW emblem? Head over to the [Creations](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) page and submit your stuff! As a heads up, we\u2019ll be getting a new emblem to hand out for MOTW in Season 12, so shoot your shot before the current offering is gone. More on that in a future TWAB.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s weird to think, six years ago I was sitting in my friend\u2019s garage, wrapped in a blanket, playing through Destiny for the first time after calling out \u201csick\u201d from work. I think my initial character was a Hunter. The cloaks were cool, and the Golden Gun shown in the trailers caught my eye. I had no clue what Rampage was, why Suros was considered good, or why anyone would care about an Exotic Rocket Launcher.\n\n\nFast forward to now, we have a massive community with multiple expansions, Exotics, weapons, subclasses, and more under our belts. You\u2019ve fought back the Darkness, lost your Light, met a Wizard that came from the Moon, and more. And now \u2013 in only a few months \u2013 after looking at beautiful concept art since 2014, we\u2019ll finally sink our boots in the snows of Europa. We\u2019ll also be embracing Darkness abilities for the first time.\n\n\nI know I\u2019ve said \u201cwe\u2019re just getting started\u201d a few times since starting on the Community team\u2026 but every release gives us a chance to set off on a new path. Fresh experiences with a sense of wonder, challenges that push you and grow your skill, and opportunities to make new friends along the way. Thanks for joining us on this wild ride.\n\n\nNow, it\u2019s time for me to hop into Iron Banner as I hunt for a few different rolls on my weaponry. I\u2019ve heard whispers from our Sandbox folk on upcoming changes to 110 Hand Cannons. Might be fun to snag a few random rolls to try out when Beyond Light ships. That conversation is for another time, though. How about next month? We\u2019ll see if this little tease makes it through editorial. If it does, I bet you 200,000 Glimmer that someone makes a five-minute YouTube video about it.\n\n\nHappy hunting.\u00a0\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied":

your titles.\u00a0\n\n\nWe are well into the final week of Solstice of Heroes. Finish upgrading your armor before the event ends with the weekly reset on September 8. If you still need time to finish any of the objectives required to unlock the white glows, you can continue to knock those out even after the event is over.\u00a0\n\n\nLast week, we began to [serve up new information on Stasis](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/BeyondLight/Stasis?ciid=48001), starting with a [new trailer](https://youtu.be/HQ92dM6MYSY). This week, we dug deeper into the [Warlock Shadebinder](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49482) and [Titan Behemoth](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49483) subclasses. There\u2019s lots of good info in there about how Stasis is going to shake up combat in Destiny this fall. You may be wondering \u201cWhat about Hunters?\u201d Don\u2019t worry - we are saving the best for last and you can read more about the Hunter Revenant subclass on September 8.\u00a0\n\n\n[*Editor\u2019s Note: Hey, Guardians. DeeJ here. Hunters may be last but they are not the best. We all know that all Guardians are created equal, assuming they are Warlocks.*]\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Triumphs Evolved\u00a0\n\nA few weeks ago, we shared [more details about the Destiny Content Vault (DCV)](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49454). We mentioned that you should start finishing off any Triumphs associated with content that is going into the Vault, but we didn\u2019t go into details on how Seals and Titles would be affected. Separate from the DCV, we have plans to rework Triumphs all up and the **Destiny Dev Team** is here to share what they have planned.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: Hello Destiny Community! We\u2019re sure you've a ton of questions about Triumphs, particularity what happens to Triumphs once the content associated with them goes into the Destiny Content Vault. We\u2019re updating how Triumphs will work going forward and want to walk you through how everything will look starting on November 10.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First, the goals!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Provide pursuits for all players.\u00a0\n&gt;* Provide seasonal pursuits that match each Season of Destiny.\u00a0\n&gt;* Provide destination pursuits for each new destination in Destiny.\u00a0\n&gt;* Ensure everyone can show off their accomplishments.\u00a0\n&gt;* Make all Triumphs have a score.\u00a0\n&gt;* Make sure it's clear what happens when content goes into the DCV.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hopefully this write-up will answer your questions and lead to more discussion going forward.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###An Evolving World\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;We touched on this subject [the last time we talked to you about Triumphs](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48369). It's critical to us that there are challenging Triumphs each Season and that only the most dedicated among you earn them all and hit the max score. ([Here's looking at you](https://giphy.com/gifs/editingandlayout-NEvPzZ8bd1V4Y), [iLulu](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48915).) At the same time, it's also important that even the freshest Kinderguardian has the same chance to climb that mountain, no matter when they join the Destiny Community. Given, of course, that they put in the time and dedication for the content available to them.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For Shadowkeep and the base Destiny 2 experience, we tried to do this by combing through each Triumph individually, looking to see if it was still achievable, and then taking the score away from any Triumph that could no longer be earned. While it achieved most of our goals, it didn't give you the ability to plan your attack to earn absolutely everything you wanted to and there wasn\u2019t a good predictor on when things would go away.\u00a0 \u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For us to hit our goals, we knew that we needed to make some changes with how we are delivering Triumphs to players.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###An Evolving Set of Triumphs for an Evolving World\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;What are we going to do?\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Reorganize Triumphs to make them more compatible with our evolving world.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Create a **Career Score** that that represents the totality of what you've done in Destiny 2.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Create an **Active Score**, for the things that can be done now in the live game.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Focus our generic Triumphs into a leaner lifetime set, that covers the basics of being a Guardian.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Organize the rest of Triumphs around Seasons and destinations.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Track the history of what you've done as Legacy Triumphs.\u00a0\n&gt;* Beyond Light will include a set of Triumphs that targets this year's destination, Europa.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * These Triumphs all have score.\u00a0\n&gt;   * They include the content on the destination (story missions, strikes, raid, Lost Sectors, and, yes, even some secrets).\u00a0\n&gt;* There will be a Set of Triumphs that targets Season 12's content.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * The Triumphs will all have score.\u00a0\n&gt;   * We like the pattern of rewarding Seasonal currency for completing these Triumphs, and will continue to do so.\u00a0\n&gt;   * These Triumphs will stick around for as long as the Seasonal content does.\u00a0\n&gt;   * While active, seasonal Triumph score will still contribute to your active score.\u00a0\n&gt;   * When the Seasonal content is no longer available, the Seasonal set moves under Legacy Triumphs.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * They no longer contribute to your **Active Score**.\u00a0\n&gt;      * They will still contribute to your **Career Score**.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Lifetime set will be about teaching players all the things you can do in Destiny.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * These will mostly target new players as they join our ranks.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;   * They will focus on helping players explore Destiny's sandbox and game modes.\u00a0\n&gt;   * If new systems are added to the game, this pool will grow.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/140/140796/EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CKWIqyE.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;(Sharp eyes will notice that we've moved Medals, Catalysts, and Lore off into their own sections, but more on that later.)\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###You keep saying 'Legacy Triumphs.' What is that?\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* For this year:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * In game, we'll remember your total Triumph score and display it on the updated Triumphs screen.\u00a0\n&gt;   * In game, we'll remember every Triumph that contributed to a Seal and display them under Legacy Triumphs.\u00a0\n&gt;   * In game, we'll let you browse through the Seals under Legacy Triumphs.\u00a0\n&gt;   * You'll be able to equip the Titles you've earned going forward.\u00a0\n&gt;   * We'll have a demonstration set targeting the Leviathan that shows how this works.\u00a0\n&gt;* We've stored the completion state of every Triumph you've finished (or not) even for Triumphs no longer displayed in game. Work is ongoing to flesh out the categories those Triumphs live in.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Going forward, when content moves to the Destiny Content Vault, Triumph sets that are no longer earnable will become Legacy Triumphs.\u00a0\n&gt;* Legacy Triumphs will contribute to your Career Score, but not your Active Score.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###What about the things that can still be earned after November 10?\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* We'll break out the Luna, Dreaming City, Tangled Shore, EDZ, and Nessus Triumphs into their own destination sets, and keep them available and contributing to your Active Triumph score.\u00a0\n&gt;* We'll move your progress into any Triumph that still exists.\u00a0\n&gt;* In some cases, we've reduced the size of the Triumph sets to make this easier to understand for new players (Gambit, Crucible, Vanguard).\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* In other cases, we've increased the size of the set and added rewards (Lifetime set).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###Does this mean some Seals may no longer be earnable?\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes. With a bunch of content going into the DCV, there are Seals and their corresponding Titles that will no longer be earnable when Beyond Light is released.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Earnable in Beyond Light:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Crucible - Unbroken\u00a0\n&gt;   * Gambit - Dredgen\u00a0\n&gt;   * Flawless - Flawless\u00a0\n&gt;   * Conqueror - Conqueror\u00a0\n&gt;   * Shadowkeep - Harbinger\u00a0\n&gt;   * Garden of Salvation - Enlightened\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;   * The Dreaming City - Cursebreaker\u00a0\n&gt;   * The Last Wish - Rivensbane\u00a0\n&gt;   * Beyond Light - [redacted]\u00a0\n&gt;   * Season 12 - [redacted]\n&gt;   * [redacted]\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Moved to Legacy in Beyond Light (and no longer earnable):\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * A Shadow Rises - Shadow\u00a0\n&gt;   * Reckoner - Reckoner\u00a0\n&gt;   * Black Armory - Blacksmith\u00a0\n&gt;   * Destinations - Wayfarer\u00a0\n&gt;   * Lore - Chronicler\u00a0\n&gt;   * Season 5 through Season 11 titles\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###What were you saying about medals, catalysts, and lore moving?\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Medals and catalysts will now have their own sections to make them more visible and easier to keep track of.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Lore will also have its own section and a brand-new UI to show off the book covers and improve the reading experience.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* All lore up through Season of Arrivals\u00a0 will be available to all players. The game will still show how many of the pages you earned, but everyone will be able to read everything now.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * \u00a0So if you want to see X out of X pages earned - go earn any missing lore pages before the end of the season as well.\u00a0\n&gt;* New lore will be unlocked through Triumphs going forward and eventually made available to everyone when they become Legacy Triumphs.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, there you go. We know it's a lot to absorb, but we think this moves us much closer to our goals of providing interesting and compelling pursuits Season over Season and year over year, while letting everyone participate. Please share any questions or feedback you have on the new Triumph plan in all the usual places.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Iron Banner\u00a0\n\nLord Saladin returns to the Tower once again next week, encouraging Guardians to\u00a0 don their most powerful gear and show their might. Powerful rewards await for all who enter Iron Banner.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Iron Banner and Bonus Valor\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;**Begins: 10 AM PDT on September 8\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;**Ends: 10 AM PDT on September 15\u00a0**\n\n\nJust in case you have recently joined us or just need a refresher, Iron Banner is a weeklong Crucible event with a specialized version of Control. If you can capture all three zones you will create a Power Play, allowing for your team to hunt your enemies who will be locked out from capturing zones for a period. Here is a look at some of the weapons and armor available to earn during the event.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/140/140796/IronBanner_Shader_Gear.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZIPEzBs.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/140/140796/IronBanner_Weapons_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/H3zrA8E.jpg)\n\n\n##\n\n***\n\nBetter, Faster, Transfer\u00a0\n\nHave you ever been trying to pull a specific weapon from your vault in the middle of a strike and had to wait precious seconds for it to trasmat into your inventory? With the latest improvements transferring items with the companion app or third-party apps is now roughly 10x faster than before! If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, go download the Destiny 2 Companion App on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/destiny-2-companion/id441444902) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bungieinc.bungiemobile&amp;hl=en_US).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFor those of you who are curious about the technical underpinnings, the BNet team has refactored the way that key components of the API flow are processed on the backend and removed affinization requirements from API features. This allowed a new approach to load-balancing and accommodating a major behavior change in Chrome where v84+ installs no longer respected same-site cookies. Transfer Item is the first function to be revised to take advantage of this. Look forward to significant new features from the API team as part of this work.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Title Bout\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PWmjP0s.gif)\n\nPlayer Support has an [entire library of helpful documents](https://www.bungie.net/en/Support) they continue to maintain to keep you informed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###UPDATE 2.9.2\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday, September 8, Update 2.9.2 will be available to players.

you were getting your first look at Stasis. Today during a virtual gamescom, we took a deeper look, introducing you to the Hunter **Revenant**, Titan **Behemoth**, and Warlock **Shadebinder** subclasses. There\u2019s quite a bit to chew on. How do the new grenades work? What about melee attacks? What *are* those things that the Hunter just threw? This is just the start.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/HQ92dM6MYSY)\n\n\nOver the next two weeks, we\u2019ll be releasing additional details through Dev Diaries, and updates to the [Bungie.net/Stasis](http://bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/BeyondLight/Stasis) page. First update is planned for September 1. Set your calendar reminders accordingly.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##An Early Patch Note Preview\n\nUsually, we have quick previews of patches the week before they\u2019re released. Even though Destiny 2 Update 2.9.2 isn\u2019t slated until **September 8**, we want to give an early preview of a few fixes and changes coming your way. Stay tuned to [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) for final timelines, as the date may shift if any issues are found.\n\n\n**Solstice of Heroes: Ornament Glows**\n\nShortly after Solstice went live, we became aware of a difference between how the universal armor glow bundle icon was depicted and how it visually performed in the game. After investigating the issue, we felt the difference between them was too vast. We have revisited the glow intensity of these ornaments and enhanced the in-game appearance to match the icon as closely as possible.\n\n\n**Sleeper Nodes**\n\nWith additional [Destiny Content Vault](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49454) details available, we\u2019re seeing many players returning to content released in the earlier years of Destiny 2. Some players are hunting Triumphs, while others are focusing on rewards. One of these rewards is the unique emblem players unlock after collecting all the available Sleeper Nodes introduced in Destiny 2: Warmind.\n\n\nDue to the way that the Sleeper Nodes were created, we are unable to completely remove the possibility of receiving duplicate Override Frequencies, but we are making some improvements to greatly reduce the odds of receiving a duplicate. The following tips will help you avoid duplicates and acquire those final elusive nodes.\u00a0\n\n\n* When combining Resonate Stems, it is very unlikely that the resulting Override Frequency will unlock a node in your current area. For example, if you need to unlock a node in Heatsink, you should leave Heatsink before creating an Override Frequency.\n* Destiny 2 has an internal checklist of nodes you have unlocked. This checklist is separate from the count you see in game, and prior to this fix, the checklist would frequently be cleared. Clearing this checklist is the reason duplicates were so common. Going forward, the checklist will never be cleared.\n\n\n   * **Note:** If you create an Override Frequency for a node that you have opened in the past, you should open the node again instead of deleting the Override Frequency. This will allow the internal checklist to be updated, and help prevent future duplicates.\n\n\nIn different terms, the team has created a form of \u201cbad luck protection\u201d for Sleeper Nodes, but the tracking is starting fresh.

First up, dishing out some rightly earned Bright Dust to players who completed Solstice bounties. Second, a fix for one of our more notorious error codes. Read on for details!\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Solstice Bounties**\n&gt;\n&gt;In [Hotfix 2.9.1.3](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49455), we resolved an issue where weekly and repeatable Solstice of Heroes bounties did not grant Bright Dust rewards upon completion. We have since granted Bright Dust to the first wave of affected players, and will be sending out a second grant in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Error Code TAPIR**\n&gt;\n&gt;We have resolved an issue causing players to encounter error code TAPIR when they try to launch Destiny 1 while they have a Twitch account linked to their Bungie.net account.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Current Known Issues**\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Some EAZ Weekly Challenges don\u2019t show up at the weekly reset.\n* Some Bungie Rewards codes are not working on the EU Bungie Store.\n* We are investigating TURTLE errors on Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 for players on CenturyLink.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

While you can hardly blame us for celebrating awesome content like that, we need to make up for it this week. We have a few extra winners to show. Top of the list, we\u2019ve got some great musical talents on display.

Now make sure you have your Bungie.net profile in the description of said video so we can send out your prize emblem.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\nSummer is fading. The days are getting shorter and even a bit darker in our neck of the woods. An evening chill is beginning to creep into the air. It\u2019s the perfect mood for Stasis subclasses to enter the realm of Destiny 2, and for our first steps on Europa in November. Just a few short months stand between you and Beyond Light.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id":

details on the DCV.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBack in June, we introduced the concept of the [Destiny Content Vault (DCV)](http://), an approach to evolving the game that will allow us to add new content, bring back some of Destiny\u2019s greatest hits from the past, and support Destiny 2 for years to come.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs a quick refresher, when Year 4 kicks off on November 10th, Io, Titan, Mars, Mercury, and Leviathan will all enter the Destiny Content Vault to make room for Cosmodrome\u2019s return and Europa\u2019s debut.\u00a0\n\n\nSince announcing the DCV, we know there have been a lot of questions about what\u2019s going away and how game systems will evolve to reflect the more dynamic nature of Destiny 2\u2019s future.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMost questions are answered by this rule of thumb, \u201cWhen a destination goes into the DCV, so too do its PvE activities and associated rewards.\u201d But there are some edge cases and we want to be crystal clear with players about the details of what\u2019s staying and what\u2019s going so there is no confusion, and everyone can prepare.\u00a0\n\n\nToday we\u2019re going to explore what Destiny 2 will look like on November 10. Then, we\u2019re going to spend some time helping you plan your gameplay to finish up your quests, earn your Triumphs, and complete your collections before November 10.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n###Core Activities\u00a0\n\nUp first are the core repeatable activities of Destiny 2: strikes, Crucible, Gambit, raids, and dungeons.\u00a0\u00a0\nStrikes\u00a0\u00a0\nThis one is covered entirely by the standard Vaulting rule of thumb. As a destination is Vaulted, its strikes enter the DCV.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAvailable Strikes on November 10|Moving into the DCV |\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\nEDZ* The Arms Dealer* Lake of Shadows|Io* The Pyramidion* The Festering Core|\nNessus* Inverted Spire* Exodus Crash* Insight Terminus|Titan* Savath\u00fbn\u2019s Song\u00a0|\nTangled Shore* Warden of Nothing* The Hallowed Lair* Broodhold|Mars* Strange Terrain* Will of the Thousands|\nDreaming City* The Corrupted|Mercury* Tree of Probabilities* A Garden World|\nMoon* The Scarlet Keep||\nCosmodrome** Will of Crota||\nEuropa* [Redacted]||\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0*Destiny\u2019s Devil\u2019s Lair and Fallen S.A.B.E.R. are coming out of the Vault in Year 4.\u00a0\n\n\nGambit and Gambit Prime\u00a0\nAs a reminder, Gambit and Gambit Prime will be merging into a single experience when Year 4 kicks off on November 10.\u00a0 The new version of Gambit will be similar to Gambit Prime as a single round face off with tweaked Blockers, heavier mote drain, and some changes to the Primeval fight. We will give more details on these updates before the revamped mode goes live next Season.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nUnlike strikes and other PvE content, the Year 4 Gambit playlist map selection is a \u201cbest of\u201d list (and is one of those edge cases we mentioned above). We felt it was important to keep the select Gambit maps in rotation for the best competitive play (regardless of their destination\u2019s fictional state).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Available Gambit Maps on November 10**|**Moving into the DCV**|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n* Emerald Coast (EDZ)* Legions Folly (Nessus)\u00a0* Deep Six (Titan)\u00a0* New Arcadia (Mars)\u00a0|* Cathedral of Scars (Dreaming City)\u00a0* Kell\u2019s Grave (Tangled Shore)\u00a0|\n\n\nNote: As we perform maintenance on the activity, Gambit Prime armor perks will be deprecated. We are exploring ways to rebalance and reintroduce some of these perks as armor mods in the future. Alongside these changes, we\u2019ll be rotating some maps into the DCV, while retaining popular arenas for the mode.\u00a0\n\n\nCrucible\u00a0\nLike Gambit, the new Crucible map playlist will be a curated \u201cbest of\u201d mix and will be pulled from both Destiny 1 and 2\u2019s legacy. Here is a look at the planned rotation in Year 4 as well as the maps being Vaulted.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n**Available PvP Maps on November 10**|**Moving into the DCV**|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n* Destiny\u00a0   * Bannerfall\u00a0\u00a0   * Exodus Blue\u00a0\u00a0   * Rusted Lands\u00a0\u00a0   * Twilight Gap\u00a0\u00a0* Destiny 2\u00a0   * Altar of Flame\u00a0   * The Anomaly\u00a0   * The Burnout\u00a0   * Cauldron\u00a0   * Convergence\u00a0   * The Dead Cliffs\u00a0   * Distant Shore\u00a0   * Endless Vale\u00a0   * The Fortress\u00a0   * Fragment\u00a0   * Javelin-4\u00a0   * Midtown\u00a0   * Pacifica\u00a0   * Radiant Cliffs\u00a0   * Widow\u2019s Court\u00a0   * Wormhaven\u00a0|* Meltdown\u00a0\u00a0* Solitude\u00a0\u00a0* Retribution\u00a0\u00a0* The Citadel\u00a0\u00a0* Emperor\u2019s Respite\u00a0* Equinox\u00a0\u00a0* Eternity\u00a0* Firebase Echo\u00a0* Gamber\u2019s Ruin\u00a0\u00a0* Legion\u2019s Gulch\u00a0* Vostok\u00a0\u00a0|\n\n\nAs Year 4 starts, we\u2019re also taking the opportunity to focus the Crucible experience by reducing the number of PvP playlists and modes to those that receive the most play. This will increase the matchmaking pools for the remaining playlists and make it easier to find matches with better connections.We\u2019ll have a full preview of Crucible changes later this Season, but here\u2019s a preview of modes that will be active, and modes that will be transitioning into the DCV:\u00a0\n\n\n**Available PvP Modes on November 10**|**Moving into the DCV**|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n* Rumble\u00a0* Clash\u00a0* Control\u00a0   * Iron Banner Control\u00a0* Elimination\u00a0   * Trials of Osiris\u00a0* Showdown\u00a0* Survival\u00a0* Mayhem Clash\u00a0|* Supremacy\u00a0\u00a0* Countdown\u00a0\u00a0* Lockdown\u00a0\u00a0* Breakthrough\u00a0\u00a0* Doubles\u00a0\u00a0* Momentum Control*\u00a0* Scorched*\u00a0|\n\n\nTrials of Osiris Note\u00a0\nIn case it\u2019s not clear from the note above, the Trials of Osiris experience is not impacted by other content moving into the DCV this year. The Lighthouse will continue to be available to those who are able to complete a Flawless passage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRaids and Dungeons\u00a0\u00a0\nNo dungeons will be rotating into the DCV this November, as all dungeon-hosting destinations will remain active in the game during Year 4. Note that the Prophecy dungeon will become temporarily unavailable for a brief period to allow our team to make a necessary technical update. Expect details on dates and timing soon.\u00a0\n\n\n**Available Dungeons on November 10**|**Moving into the DCV**|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n* Shattered Throne (Dreaming City)\u00a0* Pit of Heresy (Moon)\u00a0* Prophecy*\u00a0|* None|\n\n\nLike strikes, raids follow the simple Vaulting rule: as a destination enters the DCV, so too do its raids.\n\n\n**Available Raids on November 10**|**Moving into the DCV**|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n* [Redacted]\u00a0* Last Wish (Dreaming City)\u00a0* Garden of Salvation (Black Garden)\u00a0|* Leviathan\u00a0* Eater of Worlds (Leviathan)\u00a0* Spire of Stars (Leviathan)\u00a0* Scourge of the Past (Last City)\u00a0* Crown of Sorrows (Leviathan)\u00a0|\n\n\nAnticipating players would want to grab the coveted raid rewards and Triumphs before they enter the Vault. This year\u2019s Moments of Triumph currently features the five raids being added to the DCV with the reward lockouts removed to make grinding them extra... well, rewarding. If you\u2019re looking to earn your Raid Ring, Moments of Triumph Seal, or just finish collecting the last few items for your collection, you have the rest of the Season to jump in with your friends and close out strong.\u00a0\n\n\nWe also plan to bring the Vault of Glass out of the DCV and into Destiny 2 for the first time at some point during Year 4.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n###Completing Your Collection\u00a0\u00a0\nExotic Quests\u00a0\nAs content enters the DCV, there will be some Exotic quests that can obviously no longer be completed in their original forms. Those quests will be retired on November 10 and incomplete progress abandoned.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf you want to acquire these Exotics via their original quests, do so prior to the end of the Season of Arrivals:\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n* Sturm\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n* MIDA Multi-tool\u00a0\u00a0\n* Rat King\u00a0\u00a0\n* Legend of Acrius\u00a0\u00a0\n* Sleeper Simulant\u00a0\u00a0\n* Polaris Lance\u00a0\u00a0\n* Worldline Zero\u00a0\n* Ace of Spades\u00a0\u00a0\n* The Last Word\u00a0\u00a0\n* Le Monarque\u00a0\u00a0\n* Jotunn\u00a0\u00a0\n* Izanagi's Burden\u00a0\u00a0\n* Thorn\u00a0\u00a0\n* Lumina\u00a0\u00a0\n* Truth\u00a0\u00a0\n* Bad Juju\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNone of these legacy Exotics are being retired from Destiny 2. Their original acquisition journeys are simply entering the DCV alongside their supporting destination and activity content.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe still want new and existing players to be able to earn these legacy Exotics, so starting in Year 4, any Exotic tied to a quest that has been Vaulted (like those listed above) will now become available through a new\u00a0Memorial kiosk situated among the Vault kiosks in the Tower. We\u2019ll have more information later this Season on how the Exotic Archive works, and how to earn any Exotics that you don\u2019t get your hands on before Year 4.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNow, you may be asking \u201cHey, what about catalysts previously acquired through content that\u2019s now in the DCV?\u201d Here is a list of catalysts that are going into the DCV and will be unavailable to earn starting in Season 12.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**Available Catalysts on November 10**|**Moving into the DCV**|\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n* Ace of Spades* Black Talon* Borealis* Cerberus+1* Coldheart* The Colony* Crimson* D.A.R.C.I.* Eriana's Vow* Fighting Lion* The Fourth Horseman* Gravitron Lance* Hard Light* Jade Rabbit* Lord of Wolves* Lumina* Merciless* MIDA Multi-Tool* Prometheus Lens* The Prospector* Rat King* Riskrunner* Sturm* Sunshot* SUROS Regime* Sweet Business* Symmetry* Tommy's Matchbook* Tractor Cannon* Trinity Ghoul* Vigilance Wing* Wardcliff Coil* Witherhoard\u00a0|* Bad Juju\u00a0* The Huckleberry* Izanagi's Burden* Legend of Acrius* Polaris Lance* Skyburner's Oath* Sleeper Simulant*\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Telesto*\u00a0* Outbreak Perfected** Whisper of the Worm** Worldline Zero*|\n\n\nIf you have these catalysts already equipped and their objectives completed, you can continue using them at your leisure. If you already have any catalysts with an asterisk, make sure you finish completing the necessary objective to apply it as the objective will no longer be available at the end of Season of Arrivals.\u00a0\n\n\nAll of these catalysts will come out of the Vault and be made available with new objectives(if needed) in a future Season.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut You Still Didn\u2019t Answer My Question!\u00a0\n\n\n**Q. What goes away when a destination is Vaulted?\u00a0\u00a0**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A. When a destination enters the DCV, its PvE content will no longer be available. Explicitly, this includes their unique:\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Story missions and cinematics\u00a0\n&gt;* Strikes (detailed above)\u00a0\n&gt;* Raids (detailed above)\u00a0\n&gt;* Dungeons (detailed above)\u00a0\n&gt;* Adventures\u00a0\n&gt;* Secret missions\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Vendors and associated bounties\u00a0\n&gt;* Destination-specific patrols\u00a0\n&gt;* Collectables &amp; scannables\u00a0\n&gt;* Destination-specific activities (Ex: Mercury\u2019s Forge, Mars\u2019 Escalation Protocol)\u00a0\n&gt;* Freely roaming the destinations themselves, exploring Lost Sectors, etc.\u00a0\n\n\n**Q. What will new Guardians experience if the Year 1 campaigns are going away?\u00a0**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A. With some of the core Year 1 destinations entering the Vault, it\u2019s true that the free-for-all-players Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind campaigns will no longer be playable.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We are building a new, expanded Guardian origin story on the Cosmodrome that will launch alongside Year 4 and will be available to all Guardians to play. It is designed to introduce you to the world and mechanics of Destiny and prepare you to play the action MMO game we all enjoy. The Forsaken and Shadowkeep story campaigns will still be playable in Year 4 for owners of those expansions.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n**Q. What\u2019s happening to The Whisper and Zero Hour secret missions and their Exotic rewards?\u00a0**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A. The Whisper is entering the Vault alongside Io, and so too is Zero Hour (given the old Tower was part of the Red War campaign and which is also entering the Vault). Their Exotic weapon rewards will not be acquirable until we find a new way to reintroduce them, so if you\u2019re keen to get them, make sure you do that now!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n**Q. With the Forsaken campaign, Tangled Shore, and Dreaming City sticking around after Beyond Light\u2019s launch, does that mean other Year 2 Seasonal content will remain playable in Year 4 too?\u00a0\u00a0**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A. No. The Year 2 Seasonal content - including Forges, Reckoning, and Menagerie - will be entering the DCV on November 10. Be sure to experience that content and mark the final items off your collections and checklists before they are Vaulted. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet of what to complete:\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Ada-1, Black Armory, and Season of the Forge quests.\u00a0\n&gt;* Gambit Prime, Reckoning, and Season of the Drifter quests.\u00a0\n&gt;* Benedict-66, Werner 99-40, Menagerie, and Season of Opulence quests.\u00a0\n&gt;* Pinnacle and pursuit weapon quests.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Note: These weapons will receive an alternate acquisition method. More details to come later this Season.\u00a0\n\n\nWe have no doubt that you\u2019ll have more questions on what\u2019s coming and going this fall. We\u2019ll be sharing more updates and Destiny Player Support will always have the latest updates available in our help archives.

A few of you have already completed the majority of objectives towards your first Magnificent armor set, and are already off to the races on your alternate classes.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/KEc1ugYKHaM)\n\n\nTomorrow, Trials of Osiris will return at 10 AM PT. Seven wins might be all that\u2019s standing between you and your Magnificent glow. Form your fireteam, grab your bounties, and get ready for a fight.\n\n\nBefore we get deeper in the TWAB, we\u2019ve been seeing some questions on rewards for Solstice 2020 in comparison to years past. Let\u2019s take a moment to clear up some confusion.\n\n\nLast year, a Legendary Sparrow was available to anyone who fully Masterworked every armor piece for all three classes. We got quite a bit of feedback that this felt a little *too* grindy for a limited-time event. This year, we shifted focus to the individual Solstice of Heroes sets that you\u2019ll be investing time in over the next few weeks. Rather than a single reward after completing the armor on all three characters, we\u2019re providing a free glow when earning the Magnificent armor sets, per class.\n\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019re seeing some players asking why Magnificent armor isn\u2019t fully Masterworked when earned. This year, our approach was to give players a new path to earn high-stat rolled armor pieces outside of raids. As these armor sets have a Max Power Cap of 1,360, they\u2019ll also have a lifespan that lasts through multiple seasons. End result: Players can spend their time finding that perfect roll through Solstice packages for the duration of Solstice of Heroes. **Even after the event has concluded**, players can Masterwork their armor pieces at their leisure, and finish up some of their final Majestic objectives to unlock their glow.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/Solstice_2020_Armor_Magnificent.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GHKNoHK.jpg)\n\n\nAs a final note: Obtaining Majestic armor sets will grant progress bonuses on your other classes. So, if you\u2019re like me and got your Magnificent Hunter set already, you\u2019ll have a 2x progress bonus for your next character\u2019s Renewed and Majestic armor objectives. Once you finish that character up, your third (and maybe final) character will have a 3x progress bonus for armor objectives. Pretty sweet, huh? With this change compared to last year\u2019s event, we\u2019re expecting to see more players getting all three sets.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll be watching the conversation for the duration of the event, so be sure to sound off with feedback as you fly through the EAZ!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Bungie Foundation Update\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that Bungie Day was a month ago. Time is flying by! We\u2019ve been eager to give an update from the Bungie Foundation, concerning the Empathic Ghost Shell and the Bungie Foundation Emblem charity initiatives that were available. **Senior Foundation Manager Christine Edwards** is here today to share the details:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Christine:** Last month we celebrated Bungie Day, a beloved tradition that celebrates the best of our community \u2013 the camaraderie, the competition, and the care we all have for one another. This year we invited you to incorporate charitable giving into your festivities and you all stepped up in a big way!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We unlocked two unique ways to participate, first through direct donations and second through in-game purchases in the Eververse store. Because of each of you, we raised $602,204.31 in donations and $555,639.06 from the Empathetic Ghost shell, for a whopping **$1,157,843.37**! Every single dollar will go directly to helping kids in children\u2019s hospitals across the country by bringing them engaging digital entertainment that will brighten their day, make their treatments a little bit more bearable, and will remind them that even during hard times, their number one job is to play, smile, and be a kid.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As the parent of one of our patients put it, \u201c[iPads for Kids] has made the experience more like home. It has helped keep King engaged and distracted from the pain.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Another parent told us, \u201cDraven is three years old and has been in the hospital for ATRT in his brain since December 29, 2019. Draven just loves the iPad; it has helped him in so many ways. When he cries and we give him the iPad he stops crying. There\u2019s been times where he will fall asleep playing the iPad.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/140/140191/BungieFoundation.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KnUqd6m.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Each one of you who has given generously to the iPads for Kids program over the past few years has played a direct role in creating smiles, hope, and laughter for kids like King and Draven, along with hundreds of thousands of other kids just like them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thank you.\n\n\nTime and time again, you come together to show the world what Guardians stand for. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for being one of the best communities in this solar system.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Feeling Fashionable?\u00a0\n\n\nWith some new Majestic armor sets in the game, we\u2019d be crazy if we didn\u2019t host another fashion show. For those new to the conversation, every so often we challenge players to strut their stuff in the wilds of Destiny 2. Mixing shaders, armor pieces, Exotics, and ornaments to find the perfect set, and bonus points to those who find the perfect destination for their photo shoot. If you\u2019re selected, you\u2019ll walk home with a fancy emblem for your troubles.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138328/Fashion_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZWk8zdN.jpg)\n\n\nSolstice is a celebration, and we\u2019re excited to highlight your fashion sense. Glow up, embrace your Arc, Solar, or Void side, and send some screenshots to [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie) on Twitter with the hashtag #SolsticeFashionShow. We\u2019ll be retweeting winners through Thursday, August 20.\n\n\nNow, it wouldn\u2019t be a fashion show without theming:\n\n\n\n* Players must be wearing at least one Solstice of Heroes armor piece (Renewed, Majestic, or Magnificent).\n\n\n   * No Glows are required.\n* Players must take a picture on any destination to qualify.\n\n\n   * In other words, an image of your Guardian in the character inspection screen won\u2019t be considered!\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? It\u2019s go time! See you out there on the runway.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Dusted\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pkd6VWQ.gif)\n\n\nWith Solstice fresh on the mind, Player Support has been diving deep in the Help forums, looking for fresh issues to diagnose. Missing bright dust on bounties, inconsistent objective progress, and a few other minor issues have been discovered.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**MISSING EMBLEM CONTACT FORM**\n&gt;\n&gt;Players can be eligible to receive Destiny 2 emblems by winning Bungie community contests, purchasing items in the Bungie Store, or by donating to one of the Bungie Foundation\u2019s charity campaigns. Sometimes players don\u2019t receive their emblem for one reason or another, so we\u2019ve created a specific contact form to help them obtain their emblem.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We will help players with emblem issues from the following contests or campaigns:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Bungie Bounty (Aurora Clash)\n&gt;* Movie of the Week (Anamnesis)\n&gt;* Outstanding Artists (Aspect of Luminance)\n&gt;* Fashion Show (The Levante Prize)\n&gt;* Bungie Store\n&gt;* Bungie Foundation or Charity Drive\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Before requesting help through the contact form, please note:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players must wait at least 15 days from a qualifying contest win or charity campaign.\n&gt;* Players should first check their Spam/Junk email folder for any emails that may have their emblem code.\n&gt;* Players should check their Collections &gt; Flair &gt; General section for the emblem.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information on the various Emblem contests and campaigns, as well as how to request help, please see our [Guide for Bungie Contest Emblems](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/45686) article and [Missing Emblem Contact Form](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=49401).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**SOLSTICE BOUNTIES AND BRIGHT DUST**\n&gt;\n&gt;Shortly after Solstice of Heroes launched, Destiny Player Support became aware of an issue where weekly and repeatable bounties for the event were not giving Bright Dust as intended. We are currently investigating solutions to this issue. We are also investigating a solution for those who missed out on earning Bright Dust from these bounties during this time and will be granting Bright Dust to affected players as soon as we can. You can continue to complete and redeem your Solstice of Heroes bounties normally.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* We are aware of an issue where Gambit Prime will not count for Solstice armor with Gambit objectives.\n&gt;* We are aware of an issue where Nightfall: The Ordeals will not count for Solstice armor with strike objectives.\n&gt;* We are investigating reports of doubled progression progress on Solstice objectives not working for some players.\n&gt;* We are aware of an issue where the Majestic Solstice Bond for Warlocks has an objective that incorrectly states to get 150 Guardian Super kills. The objective progresses correctly with Arc Super kills against any enemy.\n&gt;* We are investigating an issue where shaders do not properly apply to the Majestic and Magnificent Robes for Warlocks.\n&gt;* We are investigating an issue where shaders do not properly apply to the Majestic and Magnificent Cloaks for Hunters.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Sunblock\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nUqBa9J.gif)\n\n\nHere in the States, we\u2019re in the thick of summer. Temperatures have risen, the Sun is out a little more often in Seattle, and we\u2019re slowly losing our minds one bead of sweat a time. Many of us are hiding in our living rooms with air conditioners on full blast. No better time to sit back and watch some community creations.\u00a0\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: 14 Reasons to get Excited for Solstice**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;SOLSTICE OF HEROES TODAYYYYYYYYYYYY \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73[pic.twitter.com/4dajTyaLB8](https://t.co/4dajTyaLB8)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 Chrizmo is sweating buckets (@Chrizmo_) [August 11, 2020](https://twitter.com/Chrizmo_/status/1293160772391055360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n**Honorable Mention: F is for Flawless (but not really flawless)**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/8AkvkVcj7Ts)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Space Cowboy \u2013 Tex Mechanica Approved**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/2C9QwASd9Qk)\n\n\nI love nothing more than a montage of Tex Mechanica weaponry being used to dominate the Crucible. Think you\u2019ve got better clips? Submit a video to the [Creations](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations)\u00a0page. Maybe you\u2019ll win next week. Maybe you won\u2019t. All we know is, you miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is one of those weeks where I\u2019m staying up past midnight to get some sweet loot. It\u2019s been nice jumping through older adventures while completing my Solstice armor, or finishing orb requirements through random activities like raids or Zero Hour.\n\n\nNo matter what you play, you\u2019ll gain progress towards an objective or two. Longer goals, like \u201cPlay 10 Gambit matches,\u201d I\u2019ve been doing at my own pace. A few matches here or there, then shifting to something else to keep things fresh.\n\n\nFor some of you, this is a race. For others, it\u2019s a nice stroll through memory lane. However you\u2019re tackling Solstice, we hope you\u2019re having fun. Have a great weekend, and we\u2019ll see you again soon.\n\n\n***Yum yum yum yum yum,***\n\n***-dmg04 as he picks up elemental orbs to complete his Solstice armor objectives***", "send_replies":

Solstice of Heroes.\n\n\nOnce again, it\u2019s time for the annual tradition of honoring Guardians and your great accomplishments. Our free summer event, Solstice of Heroes, starts next week on August 11.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/KEc1ugYKHaM)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe European Aerial Zone is back and full of Hive, Cabal, and Fallen enemies for you to dispatch. Defeat as many of the bosses as you can in a fireteam of three and then hunt for chests that are hidden away around the floating island. The more bosses you take down, the more rewards you will earn.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/EAZ_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/B9laR6h.jpg)\n\n\n###Armor\u00a0\n\nThis year, we have a new approach to Solstice of Heroes armor that we think is going to give you far more flexibility on how you show off your Solstice-ness.\u00a0\n\n\nSimilar to previous years, you will start with a Rare set and upgrade it into a Majestic Legendary set. Once you have all of your Legendary gear, you can start a final set of objectives to upgrade it to a Magnificent set. Here is a look at the objectives required:\n\n\n* Complete a Nightfall Ordeal on the Master difficulty.\n* Complete a Nightmare Hunt.\n* Complete Pit of Heresy.\n* Win seven Trials of Osiris matches. (Not on a single Passage)\n* Complete a Tier 5 Altar of Sorrow three times.\n\n\nCompleting these objectives will unlock a white glow on your armor. You need to upgrade your armor to Majestic during Solstice of Heroes but can continue to complete these objectives after the event ends. You can continue to earn more randomly rolled pieces for your Magnificent set in the EAZ.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/Solstice_2020_Armor_Magnificent.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tv2nJpB.jpg)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEarning the Majestic Legendary set will unlock the option to purchase a Universal Ornament set from Eververse for either Silver or Bright Dust. This ornament will change its glow to match your Elemental subclass color. Unlike last year, you won\u2019t need to purchase individual color glows. Each class set will be able to display three different elemental glows that will match whatever subclass you have equipped at the time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/Solstice_2020_Armor_Majestic.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zNhUTAL.jpg)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the Elemental glow sets are Universal Ornaments, you will be able to apply them to any armor 2.0 pieces instead of only being able to apply them to your Solstice armor like before.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link]( /pubassets/pkgs/139/139959/Solstice_Glow_swap_v2b_NR_16x9_1080p30_H264_Twitter.mp4)\n\n\nAs a bonus, all of the Elemental Universal Ornaments will also support a fourth glow for players who equip the Stasis subclass when Beyond Light releases this fall.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/Solstice_2020_Stasis_Armor_Glows_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/noAnRRS.jpg)\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOne of our goals with the Solstice of Heroes armor was to improve the experience of earning over previous years. There won\u2019t be any major armor updates, so once you earn your Majestic set it will be relevant up until next year\u2019s event. The Elemental glows being made into Universal Ornaments will ensure you can use them on any of your high stat armor going forward.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGlows can\u2019t be toggled on and off for Universal Ornaments. That is why this year\u2019s glows are always on, as they are built into their Universal Ornaments.\n\n\nThe white glow on the Legendary Magnificent set are also always on once you complete the challenge for the corresponding piece. Both the white glows and the elemental glows will increase their intensity depending on how much super energy you have at the time.\u00a0\n\n\n###Eververse\u00a0\n\nThe Eververse store will also have some shiny new things available. Every new Solstice of Heroes item will be available for both Silver and Bright Dust at some time during the event with the exception of the \u201cIron Severance\u201d Finisher.\u00a0\n\n\nHere is a quick look at some of the wares.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/JB_Solstice_Eververse.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/EIhFkCI.jpg)\n\n\nFor more info on the event, check out our [Solstice of Heroes page](https://www.bungie.net/SolsticeofHeroes).

They are tracking known issues and making sure you have info on\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###MEANS TO AN END UPDATE\n&gt;\n&gt;In [Hotfix 2.9.1.2](http://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49419), we resolved an issue some players had where they couldn\u2019t complete their \u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest nor the Prismatic Recaster Weekly Challenge. To resolve the issue, the quest will now delete from player inventories at each weekly reset. If players try to hold onto their Pinnacle Engram from the Prismastic Recaster past the weekly reset, it will be lost and players will need to complete the new quest for that week to obtain another engram.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, players will now be able to complete the \u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest on multiple characters of the same class. Each class is still restricted to a single Pinnacle reward engram and subsequent runs on characters of the same class will provide a non-powerful Legendary Engram instead.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players still having issues should file a report in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###API MAINTENANCE\n&gt;\n&gt;Until September 23, post-game carnage reports (PGCRs) won\u2019t be available between 1-4 AM PDT due to database maintenance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###RESOLVED ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players should no longer have their name censored on Steam.\n&gt;* For players who can\u2019t use chat while playing on PC, they can fix this issue by opting out of participating in the Steam Client Beta program.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The Corrupted Nightfall: The Ordeal has inconsistent respawn locations, causing players to spawn out of bounds.\n&gt;* When holding a Sword, the ability to regenerate a melee won't work for any class.\n&gt;* Some players still report that they can\u2019t claim their \u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest or don\u2019t receive a Pinnacle Engram for completing the quest.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

The more bosses you take down, the more rewards you will earn.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/EAZ_16-9.jpg)\n\n\n###Armor\u00a0\n\nThis year, we have a new approach to Solstice of Heroes armor that we think is going to give you far more flexibility on how you show off your Solstice-ness.\u00a0\n\n\nSimilar to previous years, you will start with a Rare set and upgrade it into a Majestic Legendary set. Once you have all of your Legendary gear, you can start a final set of objectives to upgrade it to a Magnificent set. Here is a look at the objectives required:\n\n\n* Complete a Nightfall Ordeal on the Master difficulty.\n* Complete a Nightmare Hunt.\n* Complete Pit of Heresy.\n* Win seven Trials of Osiris matches. (Not on a single Passage)\n* Complete a Tier 5 Altar of Sorrow three times.\n\n\nCompleting these objectives will unlock a white glow on your armor. You need to upgrade your armor to Majestic during Solstice of Heroes but can continue to complete these objectives after the event ends. You can continue to earn more randomly rolled pieces for your Magnificent set in the EAZ.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/Solstice_2020_Armor_Magnificent.jpg)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEarning the Majestic Legendary set will unlock the option to purchase a Universal Ornament set from Eververse for either Silver or Bright Dust. This ornament will change its glow to match your Elemental subclass color. Unlike last year, you won\u2019t need to purchase individual color glows. Each class set will be able to display three different elemental glows that will match whatever subclass you have equipped at the time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/Solstice_2020_Armor_Majestic.jpg)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince the Elemental glow sets are Universal Ornaments, you will be able to apply them to any armor 2.0 pieces instead of only being able to apply them to your Solstice armor like before.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link]( /pubassets/pkgs/139/139959/Solstice_Glow_swap_v2b_NR_16x9_1080p30_H264_Twitter.mp4)\n\n\nAs a bonus, all of the Elemental Universal Ornaments will also support a fourth glow for players who equip the Stasis subclass when Beyond Light releases this fall.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/Solstice_2020_Stasis_Armor_Glows_16-9.jpg)\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOne of our goals with the Solstice of Heroes armor was to improve the experience of earning over previous years. There won\u2019t be any major armor updates, so once you earn your Majestic set it will be relevant up until next year\u2019s event. The Elemental glows being made into Universal Ornaments will ensure you can use them on any of your high stat armor going forward.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGlows can\u2019t be toggled on and off for Universal Ornaments. That is why this year\u2019s glows are always on, as they are built into their Universal Ornaments.\n\n\nThe white glow on the Legendary Magnificent set are also always on once you complete the challenge for the corresponding piece. Both the white glows and the elemental glows will increase their intensity depending on how much super energy you have at the time.\u00a0\n\n\n###Eververse\u00a0\n\nThe Eververse store will also have some shiny new things available. Every new Solstice of Heroes item will be available for both Silver and Bright Dust at some time during the event with the exception of the \u201cIron Severance\u201d Finisher.\u00a0\n\n\nHere is a quick look at some of the wares.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139958/JB_Solstice_Eververse.jpg)\n\n\nFor more info on the event, check out our [Solstice of Heroes page](https://www.bungie.net/SolsticeofHeroes).

They are tracking known issues and making sure you have info on\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###MEANS TO AN END UPDATE\n&gt;\n&gt;In [Hotfix 2.9.1.2](http://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49419), we resolved an issue some players had where they couldn\u2019t complete their \u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest nor the Prismatic Recaster Weekly Challenge. To resolve the issue, the quest will now delete from player inventories at each weekly reset. If players try to hold onto their Pinnacle Engram from the Prismastic Recaster past the weekly reset, it will be lost and players will need to complete the new quest for that week to obtain another engram.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, players will now be able to complete the \u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest on multiple characters of the same class. Each class is still restricted to a single Pinnacle reward engram and subsequent runs on characters of the same class will provide a non-powerful Legendary Engram instead.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players still having issues should file a report in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###API MAINTENANCE\n&gt;\n&gt;Until September 23, post-game carnage reports (PGCRs) won\u2019t be available between 1-4 AM PDT due to database maintenance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###RESOLVED ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players should no longer have their name censored on Steam.\n&gt;* For players who can\u2019t use chat while playing on PC, they can fix this issue by opting out of participating in the Steam Client Beta program.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The Corrupted Nightfall: The Ordeal has inconsistent respawn locations, causing players to spawn out of bounds.\n&gt;* When holding a Sword, the ability to regenerate a melee won't work for any class.\n&gt;* Some players still report that they can\u2019t claim their \u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest or don\u2019t receive a Pinnacle Engram for completing the quest.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

Mystery. The Nine. Deserts, cubes, and\u2026 whiteboards? Earlier this week, we did a deep dive on our newest Dungeon, featuring some behind the scenes developer commentary. Did you miss it? Well, let\u2019s fix that. [Hit the jump](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/693334504?t=0h11m10s)\u00a0for a recap!\n\n\nThese are some of our favorite streams to host. We\u2019ve opened the minds of our designers to bridge the gap between Guardian and developer and get you into their headspace. If you\u2019re not in a place where you can watch a stream, we also released a [companion blog article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49301). What does it take to build out a dungeon? How do these ideas come about? And most importantly, how many lines did Jon To write to stay occupied when quarantine began?\n\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever put that many questions into a single intro, but it\u2019s fun to embrace the chaos, isn\u2019t it?\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Ironheads\n\nLord Saladin returns to host the second Iron Banner of the Season. Before we get too deep, if you haven\u2019t heard of the Iron Banner, let\u2019s give you a quick lesson. First, get your Power up. This activity offers Power-enabled combat in the Crucible, so that means your opponents might have an edge if they\u2019re five (or more) Power above you. Second, snag weekly bounties from Lord Saladin in the Tower before jumping in. You can earn some pinnacle power gear when completing their objectives! Third, capture the zones. The more zones you hold, the more points you get whenever you defeat an enemy. Fourth, stick with your teammates. While being a lone wolf can be fun, hunting with the pack can yield the best results.\n\n\nDuring Saladin\u2019s last visit, two Legendary weapons made their return with random rolls in tow. The Fool\u2019s Remedy Sidearm and Forward Path Auto Rifle pack a pretty good punch in the Crucible. I\u2019ve personally gotten around 400 Guardian defeats with my trusty sidearm; maybe you\u2019ll find a good roll that fits your playstyle.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139803/IronBanner_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/d57gxS1.jpg)\n\n\nAnd if you\u2019re searching for some enhanced armor mods, or armor pieces with high stat rolls, now\u2019s a great time to jump in for some PvP action. These rewards can drop simply from playing matches, or turning in tokens to Saladin between matches.\n\n\nIron Banner will be available from 10 AM on August 4 through 10 AM on August 11.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Hotfix Preview\n\nNext Tuesday, we\u2019ll have a fresh hotfix to address some issues that were introduced in Destiny 2 Update 2.9.1. While Destiny Player Support will have a run-through of patch times below, we have a quick preview of patch notes for you.\n\n\n**Nightfall: The Ordeal**\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where the Ordeal version of Lake of Shadows was inaccessible at tiers above Adept for players who do not own Forsaken.\n* Fixed an issue where the Festering Core Master Nightfall was listed as 1080 Power in the Director, but was actually 750 Power.\n\n\n   * Guardians should expect a much greater challenge when engaging with this strike.\n\n\n**Raids**\n\n\n\n* Leviathan rewards of XP, Glimmer, and chances towards Exotic Engrams or Bright Engrams are now back on a weekly lockout.\n\n\n   * Note: Weapons and armor are not affected by the weekly lockout, and can be earned multiple times a week.\n\n\n**Investment**\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where some players could not acquire the \u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest from the Prismatic Recaster.\n\n\n\n**Armor**\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where Ruinous Effigy could trigger the heal from the Stronghold Titan Exotic armor while blocking with the carry object.\n* Fixed an issue where Umbral stat Focused engrams could provide less than 10 in the selected stat.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll have a few more patch notes in the article next week, but this is a short and sweet update to tackle a few minor issues found over the last few weeks.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Maintaining Course\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jlBkPQ9.gif)\n\n\nI don\u2019t think I know many people in the Destiny community who have as much game-related information in their heads as the members of Destiny Player Support. Not only are they keeping track of upcoming fixes and patch timetables, but they\u2019re also an encyclopedia of general information. It can range from the location of a random Dreg to the angle at which skip grenades bounce when hitting a wall.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**HOTFIX 2.9.1.2**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday, August 4, Hotfix 2.9.1.2 will be available to players. Below is a timeline of Destiny 2 maintenance for Hotfix 2.9.1.2:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* 9 AM PDT (1600 UTC): Destiny 2 service maintenance begins.\n* 9:45 AM PDT (1645 UTC): Destiny 2 will be taken offline on all platforms.\u00a0\n* 10 AM PDT (1700 UTC): Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.9.1.2 begins rolling out across all platforms and regions.\n* 10:01 AM PDT (1701 UTC): Destiny 2 is back online and players can log in.\n* 12 PM PDT (1900 UTC): Destiny 2 service maintenance concludes.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For future release timelines when they are available, players should visit our [Destiny Server and Update Status](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/13125) help article. For live updates as this maintenance occurs, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed at [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Players who acquire **Calcified Light** without the Pendulum step of the Growth quest in their inventory will be blocked from completing the quest.\n* Picking up a **Throwing Hammer** while holding a Sword will not recharge Titan\u2019s melee ability when running Code of the Devastator.\n* Enemies in the **Hexahedron** encounter of the **Prophecy Dungeon** can stop spawning.\n* Previously uncensored nicknames on **Steam** are now being censored.\n* The **Seasons** tab of the Director will flash to indicate an available reward when none are there.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Sugar, Spice, and Just a Little Bit of Nice\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DJyq5zB.gif)\n\n\nHunting for a movie fitting of receiving the MOTW title can sometimes be a challenge. Every so often, we get crazy footage of raid strategies that end up making mincemeat of cosmic gods. Other weeks, the clear winner is a short film recorded entirely in-game. This week, we\u2019ve got a little bit of PvP hotness from a crafty Hunter, a fun idea for custom games to evoke some nostalgic feels, and an amazing raid save.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Knife Test**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/l5Fu-JvYjDc)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: House Rules: Rift**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/EFuXwGzPRUE)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Spire of Saves**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/_ghKPNO6d68)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Fight Against Destiny\"Fight against destiny!\"This took 56 hours please watch it[#destiny](https://twitter.com/hashtag/destiny?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#SwordArtOnline](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SwordArtOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/U2dbOvFxm6](https://t.co/U2dbOvFxm6)\u2014 Zev \u2721 (@zevcandraw) [July 23, 2020](https://twitter.com/zevcandraw/status/1286325826217156609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)** \n\n\nWant to take a swing at the title? Well, it\u2019s not a title, but a cool emblem. Either way, submit your video to the [Creations page on Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations). Make sure your Bungie.net profile is present in the description of your video, or delivery of your emblem may be delayed.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nWhile Moments of Triumph is in full swing, we still have some summer fun on the way. Solstice of Heroes begins in under two weeks! Hard to believe that it\u2019ll be August in less than two days.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139803/Season11_Calendar_LOC_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/WPvSb2y.jpg)\n\n\nNext week, we have Iron Banner to play on Tuesday, and some Solstice details to dive through in the Thursday TWAB. Now it\u2019s time to get started on my solo flawless Prophecy completion. Cozmo will give you an update next week on whether I succeeded, or failed in spectacular fashion. Until then, we\u2019ll see you starside.\n\n\nMuch love,\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w",

dark.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/Oq8Rg9tivRQ)\n\n\nToday, we had some exciting news to share on the Xbox Games Showcase. Bungie and Xbox announced that they are joining forces to bring Destiny 2 to Xbox Game Pass this fall.\u00a0\n\n\nWith an active Xbox Game Pass subscription, players will have access to the standard edition (seasonal content sold separately) of each expansion beginning with Forsaken and Shadowkeep (available September 2020) and Beyond Light (available beginning on November 10, 2020).\n\n\nLater this year we will be releasing a version of Destiny 2 that will be optimized for Xbox Series X, including 4K resolution and running at 60 frames per second. Players who already own Destiny 2 on Xbox One will be able to transfer their game to Xbox Series X for free via Smart Delivery.\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, Destiny 2 can also be streamed to your Android mobile devices via xCloud.\n\n\nWould you like to know more? [We answered some of the questions you might have here.\u00a0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49392)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Dive Deep\n\n\nMost of our fresh content doesn\u2019t end up on our streaming channels, so it\u2019s time we got back to our old antics. Next week, your Host will be the freshest face on the Community team: Nicole! She joins us in today\u2019s TWAB to discuss details on the Developer Deep Dive into the Destiny dungeon:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Nicole**: Howdy, Guardians! I hope you\u2019re all safe, healthy, and finding some fun out there. Thanks for keeping us company (not to mention each other) during these very unique days. I\u2019ve felt so welcomed since stepping into the community from the Bungie side, and I\u2019m excited to continue to explore ways to engage with and entertain you.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;During our recent participation in the St. Jude Fundraiser marathon with our friends who drive the [@GCXEvent](https://twitter.com/GCXEvent), we discovered some new ways to recreate the streaming experience from our homes\u2014which means developer commentary is coming soon to a screen near you!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You are cordially invited to dive into the Prophecy dungeon with some of the devs who created the experience.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Developer Deep Dive : Prophecy Dungeon**\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**[www.twitch.tv/bungie](https://www.twitch.tv/bungie)**\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Tuesday, July 28 \u2013 10AM Pacific**\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Come and watch us play our own game and tell you stories from its creation on the development floor. Learn more about our inspirations and motivations as we share snapshots from when it was just a work in progress. Join us in chat for the conversation!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We welcome you behind the curtain for a bit of fun, reminiscing, and insight into the life of game development.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I can\u2019t wait to talk to you all again soon, but for now, see you then!\n\n\n(Oh, and yes, we\u2019ll archive it later, for those of you who can\u2019t make it.)\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Dam Beavers\n\n\nWe would never harm our large-toothed, pond-dwelling friends, but we are on a mission to reduce the error codes that share their name. Late last week, we had some success in bringing the number of Beaver errors back down to similar levels reported in past Seasons. Here is the Destiny Dev Team with some more info on our progress.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: This past week Valve identified hardware configuration issues with 4 relays in their Chicago, Virginia, Stockholm, and Dubai data centers. In each case, the affected relay was unable to send traffic to one other relay in the same data center. If a connection to a peer went through both of those relays, then it would drop. Valve has fixed the configuration issues, and we have confirmed that the rate of disconnections in the affected areas has been reduced significantly.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;These changes have reduced Beaver error codes significantly with players in the central and eastern United States of America being impacted the most. Beaver error codes are an indication of connectivity failure and can be caused by a wide range of issues. Some Beaver error codes are caused by local internet connectivity issues. If you still experiencing a lot of Beaver errors please use follow our [Network Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Support/Troubleshoot?oid=12915) and then report any further issues on our [Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=Help&amp;tSort=0&amp;tType=0&amp;d=2&amp;lang=en).\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Back on the Menu\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/139/139167/ArticleBanner_01.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KqWNzDV.jpg)\n\n\nDestiny, the Official Cookbook released this week. It contains all kinds of Destiny inspired culinary concoctions waiting for you to whip up for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Maybe even second breakfast if you are as hungry as the Drifter usually is. [Yum yum yum yum yum.](https://twitter.com/elliottgray/status/1270896467280973826?s=20)\n\n\nEarlier this week, [we gave you a behind the scenes look](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49345) at how the cook book came to be. We partnered with Victoria Rosenthal to author this collection of recipes. She showed off her culinary and photography skills, dove deep into Destiny lore, and helped bring this fun cooking guide to life.\n\n\n[The Destiny Official Cookbook is on the Bungie Store](https://bungiestore.com/products/coming-soon-destiny-the-official-cookbook?_ga=2.221082200.1178457468.1595352193-1448863369.1589389201) right now if you want to add it your library.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Twitch Prime\n\n\nWe have extended our Twitch Prime Rewards and now we\u2019re in the bonus rounds. If you have an active Prime subscription, [visit this page](https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/destiny2) to link your Bungie.net account and claim your rewards.

An issue arose when players discovered that they had the option to choose a platform to redeem the emblem on. This wasn\u2019t intentional and we have confirmed that the platform chosen doesn\u2019t matter when players go to retrieve the emblem in-game.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Once players have redeemed their emblem, they should restart Destiny 2 and visit their Collections&gt;Flair&gt;General section to acquire the emblem.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players can\u2019t see their **responses in chat on PC** anymore.\n&gt;* **Duress and Egress lore** may disappear if the Triumphs aren\u2019t claimed.\n&gt;* The S**outh Paw** controller scheme doesn\u2019t allow Sparrows to boost.\n&gt;* The **High-Energy Fire Dawn Mod** doesn't allow Consumed with Light to stack twice when the Stacks on Stacks Dawn Mod is equipped.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in *Destiny 2*, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

Let\u2019s take a look at who caught our eye this week.\u00a0\n\n\n**Movie of the Week**: Killstreaks\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/3DiwrDjxXXE)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention**: Gotta Catch Them All\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/XQMeDGYXers)\n\n\nIf one of these videos belongs to you, congrats! Now make sure you have your Bungie.net profile in the description of said video so we can send out your prized emblem.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not the end of this week \u2013 we still have a Friday to survive - but this is how we bring \u201cThis Week At Bungie\u201d to a close. While the journey to Beyond Light has been extended, we\u2019re one week closer. That leaves a lot of time to talk about how the next expansion will change the game, as well as what you[\u2019](https://i.imgur.com/Bb7lYcX.jpg)ll want to accomplish between now and November.\n\n\nI\u2019m out next week, so be nice to Dmg while I\u2019m gone.\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1627730, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week at Bungie -

If you missed the full announcement, you can [check it out here](http://bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49340). We\u2019ll wait until you\u2019ve given it a read\u2026\n\n\n\u2026 Up to speed? While we\u2019re sad to keep the secrets of Europa under wraps for a few extra weeks, our dev team is putting in the work to deliver an adventure that is worthy of your bravery. Doing that work from our homes finds us very far away from our usual ideal of working together in a studio \u2013 currently still quarantined. So we\u2019re taking the time we need to do it right under the most challenging of conditions.\n\n\nWith the extra time between September and November, we have some plans to make the most of the suddenly longer Season.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138736/Season11_Calendar_LOC_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fE7Szs4.jpg)\n\n\n* Moments of Triumph will be extended to November 10, 2020. Cutting it close on some of those tougher Triumphs? Here\u2019s a little extra time to finish them off.\n* The show must go on: Festival of the Lost will now take place during Season of Arrivals, beginning on October 6.\n* We\u2019re planning a handful of ritual activity modifiers to look forward to:\n\n\n   * Increased Valor\n   * Increased Infamy\n   * Increased [REDACTED]\n   * A few additional Iron Banner events between September and November.\n\n\n* And more\u2026\n\n\nWe know that no amount of extra Infamy or Valor will keep your hunger satiated, but we will have a few more surprises to share on the road to launch. Stay tuned.\n\n\nIn the meantime, the pages that appeared on the day we revealed Beyond Light have been updated with all of the [new and relevant information](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/BeyondLight). Bookmark \u2018em or pass \u2018em along to your friends. Some in-game UI elements will not reflect the new launch date until a future update.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Maybe We Are Conquerors\n\nContrary to what Zavala believes, many among you became Conquerors last Season with the introduction of Grandmaster difficulty Nightfalls. Even though we turned the challenge up to 11, you were able to smash through the ranks of enemy combatants and earn your prize.\n\n\nWhile this Season will follow the same flow, completing all available Nightfalls on Grandmaster difficulty to earn the Conqueror title, we made some adjustments to activity rewards to make things feel a bit more fruitful.\n\n\nAs a refresher, here are some patch notes from [Destiny 2 Update 2.9.0](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49188):\n\n\n* Nightfall: The Ordeal\n\n\n   * Increase Masterwork material drops for Grandmaster Nightfall difficulty.\n   * Grandmaster completion at Platinum, Gold, and Silver levels now have higher chances of dropping an Exotic armor item.\n   * Grandmaster completion at Platinum level now guarantees one Ascendant Shard (with a small chance at one additional), and four Enhancement Prisms (with a moderate chance at 1-2 additional).\n   * Grandmaster completion at Gold level now guarantees two Enhancement Prisms (with a moderate chance at two additional).\n   * Grandmaster completion at Silver level now has a small chance at two Enhancement Prisms.\n\n\nSo, if you\u2019re on the hunt for that perfectly rolled Exotic armor piece, or if you\u2019re trying to fully masterwork as many armor pieces as possible, it\u2019s almost time to put your skills to the test. Slay the Darkness, claim your loot.\n\n\nGrandmaster difficulty becomes available on Tuesday, July 21, at 10 AM PT.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Farming With Dogs\n\nLast week was pretty crazy. Bungie Day brought [an update to Destiny 2](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49313), unlocking a new Exotic quest, new Umbral Engrams, and more. Five raids also entered \u201cfeatured\u201d status, losing their weekly loot lockouts. In other words, players can play the featured raids multiple times a week to grind out high-stat armor and raid Exotics that they may not have earned yet! If you\u2019ve been taking a swing at the Moments of Triumph objectives this year, you may have also noticed that the Contender\u2019s Ghost Shell from Prestige Leviathan has become available through a Triumph.\n\n\nIn the last few days, an issue came to light that the Contender\u2019s Shell perks also lost their loot lockouts. Combined with some raid encounters that could be completed in under five minutes, this led to an incredibly quick way to earn Bright Engrams, which further increased Legendary Shard and Glimmer earn rates.\n\n\nAs such, the Seeker of Brilliance perk has been temporarily disabled. Our current goal is to have a hotfix in early August that adds the weekly lockout back to this specific perk. Once we have more information on an expected patch date, we\u2019ll let you know via [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp) on Twitter.\n\n\nAs a note, the Seeker of Opulence perk remains active. If you\u2019re looking to round out your Exotic collections or earn better rolls on Exotic armor, equip this Ghost Shell before jumping into Leviathan raids!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Continued Support\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YdcEsS2.gif)\n\n\nEarlier this week, Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.9.1.1 was released, addressing a collection of issues that impacted controller inputs and general gameplay. The Player Support team has a quick list of high-frequency issues that were resolved, and a collection of other bugs that we\u2019re tracking.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**BEYOND LIGHT RELEASE DATE**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As announced previously, the new release date for Beyond Light will be November 10, 2020. With this change, the end dates for Season of the Arrivals and Moments of Triumph have also been moved to November 10, 2020 at the [weekly reset.](https://www.bungie.net/en/help/article/46165) The implementation of related systems, such as the moving of certain activities to the [Destiny Content Vault](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49167) and the effect of [Max Power Level](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49106) through Infusion, have also been pushed back.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**RESOLVED ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday, July 14, we released Hotfix 2.9.1.1. to players. This hotfix included the following resolved issues:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* **Witherhoard\u2019s projectiles** appeared randomly on screen when using abilities or when stowed away.\n* The reassigned **Interact button** didn\u2019t revive players on custom controller scheme.\n* When **Glide Jump cancelling**, Warlocks and Titans auto-jumped after landing.\n* Hunters kneeled after dodging when using **Hold Crouch**, but stood when using **Toggle Crouch**.\n* The **Fencing Salute Emote** allowed players to get out of the environment.\n* The **Emissary Whisperer Triumph** has been removed.\n* Players could get stuck in the **Prophecy Dungeon\u2019s hallway** between the Wasteland and Hexahedron areas.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* The Contender\u2019s Ghost Shell\u2019s **\u201cSeeker of Brilliance\u201d** perk has been temporarily disabled.\n* Some players can\u2019t progress the **\u201cMeans to an End\u201d** quest. While we continue our investigation, players can progress this quest by using an alternate character or joining another player who has already started the mission.\n* Players who didn\u2019t claim the reward for completing the **\u201cMeans to an End\u201d** quest in one previous week will be locked out from acquiring and completing it the following week. Players will be able to acquire the quest again the week after the blocked week.\n* Players unable to launch the **\u201cInterference\u201d mission** may be able to play through and complete it by joining someone else already in the mission.\u00a0\n* We continue to investigate the**&amp;nbsp;BEAVER error code** appearing frequently on the Steam platform.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Subtweeting\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/k4xnDMD.gif)\n\n\nA few weeks back, I challenged Cozmo to write better headlines for the Movie of the Week section. His answer? \u201cPlays Adapted For Movies.\u201d\n\n\nThis was an obvious reference to our favorite musical recently hitting a streaming service, but I still think he could do better. Now that I\u2019ve gotten that off my chest, let\u2019s get to watching some Space Magic Movie Magic.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Come on and SLAM.**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/pNgeWRtUXtc)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Is this how you UwU?**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/bX_5CpU5umA)\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to score a Movie of the Week emblem, make sure to submit your movie to the [Creations](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations)\u00a0page on Bungie.net. Throw a link to your Bungie.net profile in the description, and we\u2019ll shoot you an emblem for your troubles if you\u2019re creation is chosen.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nA major announcement like the one we dropped today creates new questions. We know you also want answers to some of the other questions you\u2019ve been asking since the original reveal of Beyond Light.\u00a0\n\n\nThose answers were hard to come by in recent weeks while we refactored our deadlines and development cycles. The good news is that now we have more time to tell you everything you need to know about how this expansion will change Destiny 2. In the weeks and months to come, we\u2019ll share all the information you need to plan your game time leading up to November 10.\n\n\nMuch love,\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false,

arrivals.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Pyramid ships have continued to arrive across the system. Along with Io, they now loom above Titan, Mercury, and Mars, with unknown intent. Guardians have continued to aid Eris in making contact through the new public event which is now located on Titan. There is also a new Exotic weapon quest available. Here is a peek if you haven\u2019t already set out to claim it.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/ka7hANO8MwU)\n\n\nThe timing of Pyramid reinforcements was impeccable, showing up on Bungie Day no less. No matter \u2013the festivities went on. Bungie Day is a celebration of you, the community. And once again, we use this totally made up holiday as a reminder of how thankful we are to get to create worlds that inspire friendship.\u00a0\n\n\nCheck out the [Bungie Day post](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49320) for the full info on the featured raids and how their weekly reward limit has been removed, as well as info on [Moments of Triumph](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/MomentsOfTriumph) and how you can [support the Bungie Foundation](https://thebungiefoundation.kindful.com/?campaign=1071086).\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##More in Store\n\n\nSpeaking of Bungie Day, as part of the celebration, we added new items to the Bungie Store and are running a sale until July 13. Make sure you go check out the goods.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138391/Bungie_Day-7-7-Beat.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eP6Wo8O.jpg)\n\n\nNow that Moments of Triumph is live, the Moments of Triumph T-Shirt is available for pre-order through Bungie Rewards (assuming you have completed the necessary Triumphs).\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138596/MoT_2020_Tshirt_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Ps7E2ni.jpg)\n\n\nIf you are brave enough to complete all five of the featured raids during Season of Arrivals, we are also offering a new Raid Ring for purchase through Bungie Rewards. It goes great with one of your many raid jackets to further showcase your PvE prowess to jealous clan mates or certain community managers.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138391/Raid_Ring_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TbB4Fmr.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Winner Winner, Emblem Dinner\n\nLeading up to Bungie Day, we ran a Fashion Show and an Art Show to show off the community\u2019s talents. We were blown away with how many truly unique and amazing entries we received for both contests. It was difficult to choose the winners, but here are the ones we liked the most.\u00a0\n\n\n###Bungie Day Fashion Show Winners\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Destiny is beautiful. \n&gt;\n&gt;Thank you for the amazing experiences [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#BungieDayFashionShow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BungieDayFashionShow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#BungieDayArtShow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BungieDayArtShow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/xzvUQ6L9pb](https://t.co/xzvUQ6L9pb)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 \ud83e\udd89owllock\ud83e\udd89 (@_owllock) [July 7, 2020](https://twitter.com/_owllock/status/1280369892881924098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[#BungieDayFashionShow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BungieDayFashionShow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)[@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Blue for you on Bungie Day \ud83e\udde2\ud83d\udc55\ud83d\udc56 [pic.twitter.com/1XwB38D79A](https://t.co/1XwB38D79A)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 Servi (@Servi38616076) [July 3, 2020](https://twitter.com/Servi38616076/status/1279000773104459776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Cold as Ice Still Somewhat Nice [#BungieDayFashionShow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BungieDayFashionShow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/tB9ExvySPT](https://t.co/tB9ExvySPT)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 DefyFly (@Flyboyah64d) [July 3, 2020](https://twitter.com/Flyboyah64d/status/1279198340530540544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This is my warlock for the [#BungieDayFashionShow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BungieDayFashionShow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) !!!

During that time, Destiny 2 players who have Twitch Prime memberships have benefitted by claiming some amazing rewards \u2013 from Exotic weapons like SUROS Regime and Prometheus Lens to Legendary and Exotic ships, Sparrows, Ghosts, weapon ornaments, and emotes.\u00a0\n\n\nToday we\u2019re pleased to announce that we\u2019re extending the Twitch Prime Rewards program in Destiny 2 for another four months. That means more amazing goodies coming your way, and all you need to take advantage of it is a Twitch Prime membership.\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet, make sure you have an active Twitch Prime subscription ([visit this page](https://twitch.amazon.com/tp) to start your free trial) and then [link your Bungie.net account](https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/destiny2). Each month, when a new drop becomes available, you can visit [this page](https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/destiny2) to claim your haul. Once that\u2019s done, visit Amanda Holliday in the Tower\u2026 just make sure you\u2019ve got room in your inventory for all the sweet loot! Our next set of Twitch Prime rewards are scheduled to arrive on July 22 featuring a certain Exotic weapon used for booping.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you have other questions regarding Destiny 2 and Twitch Prime Rewards, check out our [Help article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=48656) with more details on how everything works.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Giving Back\n\nThere have been a lot of opportunities this year for you to support a good cause. From Direct Relief to our own Bungie Foundation, you all embrace the Guardian spirit and never shy away from stepping up to help others.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been working with our local Boys &amp; Girls Club to provide essential services and meals to kids who are currently out of school.\n\n\nOur iPads for Kids program has allowed doctors across the country to provide visual telehealth and communication services for patients while saving valuable PPE equipment.\n\n\nHere is a look at how your support is helping with these ongoing endeavors.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/Wnt2HePxa3M)\n\n\nWe're continuing our campaign that began on Bungie Day and a [direct donation](https://bung.ie/iPadsforKids20) of $25 or more will earn you the Bungie Foundation Destiny 2 emblem. 100% of your donation will support the iPads for Kids program!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138391/Charity_Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/okQaJNC.jpg)\n\n*Note: A unique emblem code will be emailed to you within 48 hours of your donation. One emblem per donor.\n\n\nThe Exotic Empathetic Ghost Shell is still available on the Eververse Store! 100% of profits will support the iPads for Kids program.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138391/Charity_Ghost_16-9_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qNsWCon.jpg)\n\n*Note: Perks include the following:\n\n\n\n* Guiding Light\n* Speed Demon\n* Random Destination Perk\n\nThe Bungie Foundation emblem and Exotic Empathetic Ghost Shell will be available until July 21.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Masterful Triumphs\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HSNwwBx.gif)\n\n\nSometimes there are a few rough edges to smooth out when new content launches. The Player Support team is there to monitor the help forums and identify any issues that arise so we can keep you informed and get fixes rolling.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###TWITCH EXTENSION\n&gt;\n&gt;Last week, our [*Destiny 2* Twitch Extension](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48844) received an upgrade. Viewers can now gift two subs to their favorite streamer in exchange for a shader, emblem, and other loot.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who didn\u2019t receive them loot can contact us using our [Twitch Extension Gift Subs contact form](https://www.bungie.net/en/Support/Troubleshoot?oid=48947).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Please note:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Gift sub progress **only counts** in a desktop browser. Gifting subs through the Twitch mobile app and mobile browser won\u2019t count.\n&gt;* Viewers should refresh the stream they are watching if they encounter issues with bounty progress after purchasing gift subs.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###NIGHTFALL: THE ORDEAL STRIKE CHANGE\n&gt;\n&gt;After [Update 2.9.1](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49313) went live, it was discovered that the Festering Core Nightfall: The Ordeal strike wasn\u2019t reflecting the correct difficulty level at the Master tier. To mitigate this issue, [on Wednesday](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1280914252442636290) we changed the Nightfall: The Ordeal strike to The Pyramidion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###BUNGIE DAY EMBLEM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Bungie Day emblem, Septenary Encryption, will be available to redeem next Tuesday, July 14, after the weekly reset.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;GCX CHARITY EMBLEM\n&gt;Earlier this week, emails were sent out to those who donated exactly $50 or $100 during our June 18 [GCX Charity Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/654475244?filter=archives&amp;sort=time) time of 9 AM to 1 PM PDT. Those who donated $100 will receive another emblem next Season. Players who believe they didn\u2019t receive an email should look in their Spam folder, or create a thread in our Help Forum.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While emblem codes are no longer available, St. Jude is still accepting donations [here](https://donate.tiltify.com/st-jude-children-s-research-hospital/gcx-2020).\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various k[nown issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues we\u2019re looking into that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players **should only** destroy Savathun\u2019s Eyes using the Ruinous Effigy Exotic Trace Rifle itself. Progress **doesn\u2019t count** toward the Hive-God Optimist Triumph in the Moments of Triumph 2020 Seal if a player destroys Savathun\u2019s Eyes using the Orbs generated from Ruinous Effigy.\n&gt;* The **Lucent Blade armor mod** doesn't always appear on Season 11 armor.\n&gt;* The **Energy Converter Mod** won\u2019t grant Super energy if a player already has over 50% of their Super. This is by design.\u00a0\n&gt;* **Armor ornaments** from the Eater of Worlds and Spire of Stars Raids no longer appear on player Collections.\n&gt;* Some players can\u2019t progress the **\u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest.** While we continue our investigation, players can progress this quest by using an alternate character or joining another players who has already started the mission.\n&gt;* Players **who didn\u2019t claim the reward** for completing the \u201cMeans to an End\u201d quest in one previous week will be locked out from acquiring and completing it the following week. Players will be able to acquire the quest again the week after the blocked week.\n&gt;* Players **unable to launch the \u201cInterference\u201d mission** may be able to play through and complete it by joining someone else already in the mission.\u00a0\n&gt;* We continue to investigate the **BEAVER error code** appearing frequently on the Steam platform.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

grip on the Crucible.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s only been two days since the weekly reset, our feeds have been themed to the Iron Banner. Power-enabled combat can be a tough challenge, but it\u2019s well worth the effort. This Season, The Forward path and Fool\u2019s Remedy made their return with random rolls and brand new Iron Banner perks. Some weapon specialists among you have been diving deep into perk combinations, giving recommendations on the best rolls for success.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138328/IronBanner_Weapons_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/isROHe2.jpg)\n\n\nAdditionally, some changes were made to our Seasonal quest offering to make these returning weapons a bit more accessible. If you haven\u2019t already, stop by Lord Saladin in the Tower to kick off your Seasonal quest, and make sure to grab your four weekly bounties to earn some Pinnacle gear as you play. A few of you also noticed that Enhanced Armor Mods have a chance to drop on match completion, so games have felt a little more rewarding.\n\n\nGear up, form a fireteam, and get out there. Lord Saladin is waiting.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Sub-Training\n\nA few months back, the official Twitch Destiny Extension was released, giving players the opportunity to showcase their builds while playing Trials of Osiris every weekend. We\u2019ve been slowly building this feature and introduced bounties to earn Trials Tokens when reacting to matches. Tuesday, we introduced a new bounty which brought quite a buzz to the [Destiny directory](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Destiny%202).\n\n\n**Gifted Subs Bounty**\n\n\n\n* Gift 2x subscriptions to any Twitch steamer live-streaming Destiny 2 when they have the official Twitch Destiny Extension active.\n\n\nWhile this bounty will be available weekly, your first completion will award you two exclusive rewards: the \u201cStream of Light\u201d emblem and \u201cWatcher\u2019s Shade\u201d shader, each of which will be available from Amanda Holliday in the Tower.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138328/Twitch_Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jOoPxqC.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138328/Twitch_Shader.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OSlu8ch.jpg)\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a few questions popping up on this, so let\u2019s get to some answers.\n\n\n* Do I need to do anything before gifting subscriptions?\n\n\n   * Yes. You must ensure that your Bungie.net account is linked to your Twitch account to gain progress towards bounty completion. [Head over to the Help Article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48844) for information on how to do this!\n* Can I gift subscriptions to any streamer to get these rewards?\n\n\n   * If the streamer is actively playing Destiny 2 on Twitch with the official Twitch Destiny Extension, you can complete bounties to unlock rewards.\n* Can I complete bounties on my phone?\n\n\n   * No. Bounties may only be progressed when watching streams on a browser.\n   * **Note:** The team is currently looking to expand functionality here, so stay tuned!\n* I\u2019ve completed the bounty, but don\u2019t see rewards. What gives?\n\n\n   * If you see the bounty completed on the extension, sign out and back in to Destiny 2 before visiting Amanda Holliday.\n* How long will this bounty be available?\n\n\n   * At this time, there is no planned end date. While the emblem may be earned a single time, the bounty may be completed weekly for other in-game rewards.\n* How do I get the extension?\n\n\n   * Head over to the official [Twitch Destiny Extension help article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48844) for all the info you need.\n\n\nFor more information about the extension, Twitch bounties, and more, visit this help article: [https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48844](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48844)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Soon (Tee Em)\n\nNext week, we have a celebration. Bungie Day, a day dedicated to celebrating the community, is on the calendar for next Tuesday (7/7/2020). Yes, we love sevens, but we also love YOU! We have some fun planned, but until then, here are a few things to keep you occupied as we approach the day of seven.\n\n\n**Bungie Day Fashion Show**\n\nIt\u2019s no secret, we have a thing for the color blue. Slap on your favorite blue shader, grab a screenshot of your Guardian out in the worlds of Destiny 2, and tweet [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/bungie) with the tag **#BungieDayFashionShow**. We\u2019ll retweet the winners on Bungie Day proper, and grant them the \u201cLevante Prize\u201d emblem for their troubles.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138328/Fashion_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CdIwTRR.jpg)\n\n\n**Bungie Day Art Show**\n\nFashion isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s on our minds. The artists of the Destiny community are some of the best, and we\u2019re excited to see what you\u2019ve got. Draw your Guardian, your favorite Vanguard, most feared raid boss, or whatever your heart desires that\u2019s Destiny themed. Tweet [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie) with the tag **#BungieDayArtShow**. Like the fashion show, we\u2019ll retweet winners on Bungie Day and grant winners the \u201cAspect of Luminance\u201d emblem.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138328/v460.offers.entitlements.emblems.crm.emblem12.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZKJPtfo.jpg)\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited for next Tuesday, as we love celebrating this community.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patch Note Preview\n\n\nNext Tuesday, we also have a patch going live in Destiny 2. Destiny 2 Update 2.9.1 will bring a slew of bug fixes to Season of Arrivals. Here are a few items to expect:\n\n\n* Contact Events\n\n\n   * Fixed an issue where the \u201cHeavy Hitters\u201d Triumph was not progressing when defeating bosses.\n   * Fixed an issue where players could collect and bank 15 motes prior to unlocking the appropriate Prismatic Recaster rank reward.\n* Contact Weapons\n\n\n   * Fixed an issue where Cold Denial and Falling Guillotine didn\u2019t offer two perks in the final column when unlocking the \u201cUmbral Enhancement III\u201d gift on the Prismatic Recaster.\n   * Fixed an issue where Falling Guillotine could continue damaging enemies after the Heavy attack animation had completed.\n* Sleeper Catalyst\n\n\n   * Fixed an issue where reissued Seraph weapons were not granting progress to Catalyst objectives.\n* Last Wish and Garden of Salvation\n\n\n   * Updated gear to have Season of Arrivals Max Infusion Caps.\n* Weekly Vanguard Bounties\n\n\n   * Removed Scorn, Cabal, Vex, and Fallen variations of Weekly Bounties from the Season of Arrivals pool.\n\n\nFull patch notes will be published when we make the download available, so keep an eye on Bungie.net for more.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Ground Control to You\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xBLnqjQ.gif)\n\n\nNo matter the conditions, Player Support is at the ready to lend a helping hand. Destiny 2 Update 2.9.1 is on approach, and the team has some valuable information as it comes in for landing.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**UPDATE 2.9.1**\n&gt;\n&gt;Update 2.9.1. will be released to players on Tuesday, July 7.

Players will be able to progress the quest again the following week.\n* The Unfurl the Banner Crucible quest step updates when players reach the Mythic Valor rank, not the Fabled rank.\n* The Font of Light armor mod's description does not match its effect.\n* Witherhoard's projectiles can appear randomly on screen when it's stowed.\n* Seasonal mods for Season of Arrivals are not appearing in players\u2019 Collections.\n* The Fate of All Fools perk for the Jade Rabbit scout rifle is not working as intended.\n* When Warlocks or Titans cancel their jump, they can sometimes auto-jump when landing.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Picture Time\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yRzLmsO.gif)\n\n\nLast week, Cozmo titled this section Movie Time. This week, I\u2019m rolling with Picture Time. Why? Because it\u2019s a moving picture! This is me calling Cozmo out for using such an EASY title last week. Like, c\u2019mon man. I\u2019m not being mean, I\u2019m just being real\u2026. good with words. Also, stop yelling at me in meetings. It hurts my ears!\n\n\nBut who cares about any of that. Here are some really cool videos that we\u2019ve seen in the last week. Hope you enjoy them.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Spin to Win**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/1RhUo5aHaus)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Falling Apart**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/CacvxMXi650)\n\n\nSo, you\u2019ve been featured. You\u2019re hype. Your view count is going up, but you\u2019re left with wondering, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\nMake more videos! Submit them to the [Creations ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations)page. See if you can snag the elusive double feature. If you win, we\u2019ll be sending you and contributors a sweet emblem in the next week or so. Keep your eyes peeled on your Collections tab.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThanks for stopping by for another week of Destiny news. My fingers are itching to get back in to the Iron Banner, but we have a few hours of the workday to get through. The feedback never stops, and neither does development of Destiny 2.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll see you next Tuesday for Bungie Day. Cheers to all of you for being a great community.\n\n\nMuch love,\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w",

reflect.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore we talk about the game, we are going to talk about the incredibly important conversation that is taking place online and the events that lead to it. Many courageous women have come forward with stories of\u00a0 harassment and abuse. There has been a lot of pain laid bare in story after story told by these survivors.\u00a0\n\n\nSome of us have not experienced this pain first-hand and can\u2019t truly understand it. Yet, there are many people in our community feeling empathy, sadness, and anger when confronted with the truly awful harassment and abuse that so many of our friends have had to endure. Sadly, this wasn\u2019t isolated to our corner of the world and has also affected men and non-binary folks as well. In the days that followed the initial revelations, we witnessed more people who have been similarly affected coming forward. This is a bigger issue that the entire gaming industry needs to face. Together, we can take action to make the spaces we share better for everyone.\u00a0\n\n\nAmidst all of this heartache, it has been inspiring to see these stories met with a wave of love, belief, and support that is turning into momentum for more change. Thank you for reaffirming that, though every community has problems, ours doesn\u2019t shy away from confronting them and banding together to overcome them head-on.\u00a0\n\n\nWe have [reaffirmed](https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1274766587317219328?s=20) our commitment to enforce the standards of our code of conduct on the platforms and channels we control. We are currently working on other ways we can help combat toxicity and abuse in the gaming community. This is going to take time, but we pledge our support to help make things better.\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the game we have made, in the hopes that it might further inspire friendship.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Strike While the Iron\u2019s Hot\n\nThere is a time for harmony among players and a time for honorable battle as well. The venerable Lord Saladin will see to it himself. Next week, he\u2019ll return to the Tower for the first Iron Banner of Season of Arrivals.\u00a0\n\n\nBonus Valor will also enabled throughout the week.\n\n###Iron Banner and Bonus Valor\n\nBegins: 10 AM PDT on June 30\n\nEnds: 10 AM PDT on July 7\n\nThe event will work similar to last Season with a few new rewards. We will be adding two reprised weapons and curating the weapon reward pool down to eight weapons.\n\n\n* Reprised Weapons\n\n   * The Forward Path\n   * The Fool\u2019s Remedy\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138224/IronBanner_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YgmjwoN.jpg)\n\n\nAll weapons listed below are considered \u201creissued\u201d and will have Season of Arrival Max Infusion Caps.\n\n\n* Shining Sphere\n* Swarm of the Raven\n* Talons of the Eagle\n* Bite of the Fox\n* Orewing\u2019s Maul\n* Crimil\u2019s Dagger\n\n\nThe Forward Path and The Fool\u2019s Remedy will also be updated to have two additional perks specific to these Iron Banner weapons. Here is a look at what they do:\u00a0\n\n\n* Iron Grip - Improves weapon stability at the cost of reload speed.\n\n\n* Iron Gaze - Improves weapon target acquisition at the cost of stability.\n\n\nThe armor set this Season will be a reprise of the Iron Fellowship set. Here is a look at it with the new shader as well as the new emblem for this Season:\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138224/IronBanner_Shader_Gear.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OhAkIpT.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/138/138224/v490_Iron_Banner_Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JA36Jyu.jpg)\n\n\nWe also want to remind players that skill-based matchmaking has been disabled in Iron Banner this Season.\n\n\nSpeak with Saladin after the reset and then get out there and prove your worth to the Iron Lords of the past.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Be Heard \u2013 Now Available for Pre-Order\n\nOn Juneteenth, we shared an [article announcing our Be Heard \u2013 Black Lives Matter pin](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49284) and spoke about the significance of the day. Go read it if you haven\u2019t had the chance to yet.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/137/137952/Bungie_BLM_pin_render_TWAB.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Qq2XWvf.jpg)\n\n\nPre-orders for the pin are now live on the Bungie Store. All profits from the sales of the Be Heard Collectible Pin &amp; Emblem will benefit the [Equal Justice Initiative (eji.org)](http://eji.org/). All pre-orders will include the \u201cBe Heard\u201d emblem that will be emailed within 24 hours of your order.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/137/137952/BLM_Emblem_Display.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8NBSzBA.jpg)\n\n\nWe have already had tens of thousands of Guardians showing their support. Thank you so much for supporting this cause and showing your support in game.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Twitch Prime\n\nThis week we rolled out our sixth straight month of Twitch Prime Rewards. If you have an active Prime subscription, [visit this page](https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/destiny2) to link your Bungie.net account and claim your rewards. After that, they should be available at Amanda Holliday in the Tower.

We will announce when these emails have been sent out, so please follow us [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie) on Twitter to keep up-to-date on these emblems and our latest news.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###PROPHECY DUNGEON\n&gt;\n&gt;Due to an exploit, we have disabled the final checkpoint in the Prophecy dungeon\u2019s final room which occurs after the boss has been defeated. Players who had a checkpoint in the final room will have their checkpoint removed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###RESOLVED ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday, June 23, we released Hotfix 2.9.0.2. to players. This hotfix included fixes to the following issues:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Gear could drop at **750 Power** instead of near player\u2019s actual Power.\n&gt;* The **\"Upgrade Gift Ranks\" Triumph** wasn't tracking gift ranks purchased at the Prismatic Recaster.\n&gt;* The **\"Prophecy Dungeon Solo\" Triumph**\u00a0wasn't unlocking when players solo the Prophecy dungeon.\n&gt;* Console players were experiencing **blacked out emblems**, **invisible ships**, a**nd a Power Level of 0** in orbit.\n&gt;* The **Almost Mighty Exotic Ghost Shell** and the **Saint's Vocation Exotic ship**\u00a0were appearing invisible.\n&gt;* The **Tommy's Matchbook Catalyst quest** had been removed from player inventories.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;##CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players who have previously completed the **Tommy\u2019s Matchbook Catalyst quest** are being given the quest again.\n&gt;* Characters are unable to pick up the **Means to an End quest** from the Prismatic Recaster.\n&gt;* The **Masterworked Trinity Ghoul Exotic Bow** is not tracking enemies defeated using chain lightning damage.\n&gt;* **Jade Rabbit\u2019s Fate of All Fools perk** is no longer activating.\n&gt;* The **Rival Warlock Shell** from the Guardian Games doesn\u2019t show Ghost Projections.\n&gt;* Players may freeze when **respawning in Gambit**.\n&gt;* Players who purchased the \u201cBe Heard\u201d collectible pin and receive an emblem code that states \u201ccontact merchant for license\u201d should reach out to [Bungie Store Customer Service](https://bungiestore.com/pages/customer-service).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in *Destiny 2*, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Movie Time\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4TELlmI.gif)\n\n\nEvery week we deliver the movies that you create. It\u2019s kind of like Netflix, back when they actually mailed you physical movies. Remember that? Weird, right? Well, we don\u2019t actually mail you these movies, we just link you to the video \u2013 which is actually more like Netflix now. What were we talking about? Oh yeah, here are the winners.\u00a0\n\n\nMovie of the Week: Doesn\u2019t Hurt to Ask\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/ikEcDZpXzA4)\n\n\nHonorable Mention: Pass the Ghost\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyLdKsezIWU)\n\n\nAs always, the creators of these videos will be awarded a special emblem in the game. If you won, congrats! Make sure you add your Bungie.net profiles in the description of the video or a comment so we know that you are you.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\nThe intro was pretty heavy, but those things needed to be said. We also want to remind you all that we\u2019re immensely proud of you as a community. Last week saw some truly inspiring triumphs to talk about as well. You donated over $800[,](https://i.imgur.com/nrkrwRF.jpg)000 dollars during our four-hour block for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. Donors went on to raise more than $6 million for the entire marathon.\n\n\nWe want to thank our friends at [GCX](https://twitter.com/GCXEvent) for creating a platform where we can all join forces to make the world a better place \u2013 like Guardians do. Thanks to everyone who participated and donated. When you come together, you all do amazing things. Keep doing them.\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1571372,

streaming\u2026 for the kids!\n\n\nHello there. If you\u2019re reading this right at the moment of publication, then congratulations. You\u2019ve just hit the $100k benchmark for our slot on the [GCX stream](https://www.twitch.tv/gcxevent)! If you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, let\u2019s break it down.\n\n\nBetween 9 AM and 1 PM PDT today, we\u2019re live on the [GCX Marathon Charity Stream](https://twitter.com/GCXEvent), raising funds for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital to help support children in need. Your donations help families around the world by contributing to the research and treatment of cancer. While you can take pride in helping by donating a few dollars, we also have a variety of incentives to provide some additional motivations.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/137/137758/Bungie_Donation_Incentives_Chart.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/r2gE5Nr.jpg)\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t donated, this is your chance! And if you missed our live stream, no worries \u2013 this initiative is being supported by many in the gaming community. [Jump in and check it out](https://www.twitch.tv/gcxevent).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Another Patch in the Pipe\n\n\nThis week has been a pretty active one in terms of patches. On Monday, a change was made to require players to re-queue for Forges in hopes of removing idle players from the activity. Tuesday, we had some fixes go live for energy and Umbral Engrams. Today, Hotfix 2.9.0.1 went live with fixes to Sprint Cancelling, the Lighthouse, and more. But we aren\u2019t done yet.\n\n\nHotfix 2.9.0.2 is planned for next week. We\u2019re in the process of finishing up some testing passes, but here are a few things you can expect:\n\n\n* Fixes targeting controller remapping.\n\n\n   * Issue where double-tapping buttons sometimes does not trigger Dodge or other abilities.\n   * Issues where weapons don\u2019t fire when pulling a trigger.\n   * Issue where Stormtrance would sometimes not function.\n* Fixes an issue where Witherhoard deals excessive amounts of damage to various bosses.\n* Fixes an issue where solo completion of the Prophecy dungeon does not unlock the associated Triumph.\n* Fixes an issue where various reward sources are dropping at 750 Power, rather than at the Guardian\u2019s Power Level.\n* Fixes an issue where the Tommy\u2019s Matchbook Catalyst quest was removed from player inventory.\n\n\nWe have a laundry list of other issues that the team is currently investigating. Our next update is planned for early July, so stay tuned for another Patch Note Preview in the coming weeks.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Beyond Light Pre-Order Bonuses\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/137/137790/Preorderitems.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/WcQesu7.jpg)\n\n\nAlongside Season of Arrivals, we announced [Destiny 2: Beyond Light](https://youtu.be/h-5S82ETKvI)!

Since well before launch, they\u2019ve been helping the teams triage issues, representing your voices in the meetings that matter most. This last week has been no different, as they\u2019ve been tackling each newly discovered issue from Season of Arrivals.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**FORGE MATCHMAKING UPDATE**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Earlier this week, we [implemented a change](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1272659729349664769) to the Forge activity where players now return to orbit after completing the activity. This change was implemented after seeing a large amount of players entering the activity and being inactive, ruining the experience for other players.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**RAID GEAR AND MAX POWER LEVELS**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In our [May 14 TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49027) we announced that gear would begin to have a Max Power Level starting in Season of Arrivals, but that weapons and armor from the Last Wish and Garden of Salvation raids would be granted exceptions. Currently, this gear doesn\u2019t indicate that, but it will in a future update. Both armor and weapons from Last Wish and Garden of Salvation will be updated retroactively with the Season of Arrivals watermark and will have a Season 14 Max Power Level.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, all armor from all other Destiny 2 raids will be updated retroactively with the Season of Arrivals watermark and will have a Season 14 Max Power Level.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players can read more about Max Power Levels in our [Help article](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49106).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**EMOTE BUNDLE AND PRE-ORDER ITEM LOCATION**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who purchased the Season of Arrivals Silver and Emote Bundle will find their Emote in the inventory pages of Master Rahool, the Cryptarch, in the Tower Courtyard.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who pre-ordered Destiny 2: Beyond Light will also find their items in Rahool\u2019s inventory pages.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**UPDATES AND UPCOMING HOTFIXES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On [Tuesday](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1272939920550551553), we issued a server-side fix to resolve a few issues:\n\n\n* Players weren't receiving the appropriate amount of Twisted Energy after unlocking Umbral Enhancement II.\n* Focused Umbral Engrams could sometimes decrypt at higher Power than intended.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Earlier today, we released Hotfix 2.9.0.1. This hotfix included the following resolved issues:\n\n\n* Sprinting on a controller would cancel if clicked again.\u00a0\n\n\n   * We are still investigating other controller remapping issues and have listed them in [this thread](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/256301775?sort=0&amp;page=0).\n* Prime Engrams were rewarding Warlocks with Hunter armor.\n* Umbral Engrams couldn\u2019t be removed if a player had a full inventory but had completed the Season of Arrivals introduction quest. Players in this state can now remove these engrams.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Tuesday, we will release Hotfix 2.9.0.2. More details will be provided soon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Grenade Launchers may be causing crashes when used in the Crucible.\n* Console players may experience blacked out emblems, invisible ships, and a Power Level of 0 in orbit. To resolve this issue, [click here and follow the directions](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1271198618058276865).\n* The Almost Mighty Exotic Ghost Shell and the Saint's Vocation Exotic ship appear invisible.\n* Some players are unable to accept the weekly \"Means to an End\" quest from the Prismatic Recaster.\n* The \"Nascent Dawn 1/5\" quest step can't be completed because the Sleeper Node at CB.NAV/RUN.()Dynamo.Approach.Arch is missing.\n* The \u201cBecome Legend\u201d quest step to reach 950 Power doesn't update when players reach 950 Power. This will update when players reach 1000 Power.\n* The Tommy's Matchbook Catalyst quest has been removed from player inventories.\n* The \"Upgrade Gift Ranks\" Triumph doesn't track gift ranks purchased at the Prismatic Recaster.\n* The \"Prophecy Dungeon Solo\" Triumph doesn't unlock when players solo the Prophecy dungeon.\n* The \"Contact: Heavy Hitters\" Triumph doesn't accurately update when the appropriate Taken boss killed.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

I may have eaten a piece of bread or two. Cozmo may have lost his mind, again. Who knows, maybe we\u2019ve already unveiled some Destiny 2: Beyond Light concept art. Either way, it\u2019s all for the kids.\u00a0\n\n\nOh, and before we forget! If you all somehow reach 500 thousand dollars in donations, Cozmo and I are going to get matching tattoos.

Over the weekend, we watched as Rasputin sent literal ordnance into the sky to take down the Almighty in Destiny 2\u2019s first live in-game event. We followed that up with a mighty salvo of virtual launches in the form of media, articles, and a stream to showcase the future of Destiny. Season of Arrivals has started building a bridge to this fall, when Guardians will wield the Darkness for the first time in Destiny 2: Beyond Light.\n\n\nHere\u2019s the full stream in case you haven\u2019t had a chance to watch yet.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/x8K6L1wr7fs)\n\n\nDon\u2019t have time to watch the full stream? Here are a couple of the first looks at Destiny 2: Beyond Light.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/h-5S82ETKvI)\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/Ms90okhAbTw)\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited about the future of Destiny. To lay the groundwork, we have to make some changes to the core game. Several less-explored locations and activities will be going into the Destiny Content Vault (DCV) to pave the way for new hotness like Europa coming this fall. We lay out a lot of information on what to expect in our [Building a Viable Future in Destiny 2 article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49189). We know you have a lot more questions and we\u2019ll have answers to share throughout the summer.\u00a0\n\n \n\nSince Season of Arrivals acts as a prelude to Beyond Light, we have held our plans for the Season close to our chest until the reveal this week. The Pyramid ships have begun to arrive on Io and Eris is hard at work trying to decipher their intentions. She needs your help.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/5tJwLjVfFPc)\n\n\n\nOh, and did we mention there is a brand new dungeon? Prophecy is free to all players and transports you into a strange dimension to seek out the IX. It\u2019s got some real Rainbow Road vibes too. Here\u2019s a peek.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/ManQHg9_MiU)\n\n\nThe future is bright and full of new challenges to tackle. We hope to see you out there.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Match Made in Heaven\n\nBy the time that this TWAB is published, a few changes to Crucible matchmaking will be live. Matchmaking based on player skill has been removed from all playlists except Elimination, Survival, and Survival: Freelance. Trials of Osiris will continue to be matched based on the number of wins on your Passage.\u00a0\n\n\nWe are doing this to:\n\n\n\n* Respond to community feedback.\n* Shorten queue times for players.\n* Improve connection quality of matches.\n* Provide more places where the outcome of the match isn\u2019t as important as enjoying the experience.\n* Play into the strengths of Crucible being a bombastic, frenetic action game.\n\n\nThe pursuit of Glory Points in Survival and attempting to go Flawless in Trials of Osiris will allow those playlists to reinforce that the outcome of matches are important and keep the stakes high. We want the rest of the Crucible to be less of a high-stakes environment where players can have a more relaxed experience and just enjoy the Destiny multiplayer sandbox.\n\n\nWe will continue to monitor feedback and game data around these changes. If we decide to make any further adjustments, we\u2019ll let you know.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Counted You One of My Crew\n\n\nThe **Destiny Dev Team** has a quick update on a change we are making to the Dredgen title.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: Hey everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As you may have [read here](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126), we made some changes to the World Loot Pool. As a result, a few of the legendary weapons in the Playing for Keeps Collection badge no longer have a reward source in the game.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we still strongly believe that gear collection is a critical part of what it means to earn and wear a title, we\u2019re going to remove the Playing for Keeps badge from the Dredgen title requirements in an update next week. While not trivial, the badge didn\u2019t represent the challenging portions of earning the title. We feel removing this requirement doesn\u2019t reduce the meaning of wearing Dredgen over your head. That said, we don\u2019t like making changes to titles as their complexity and depth is what gives them meaning, but in this case, the long-term weapon health outweighs a small change to the title.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We know you have a lot of questions about how our Destiny Convent Vault announcement this week will affect other Triumphs and titles. We will have more details for you soon.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thank you, and keep sending us feedback as we strive to make a meaningful, evolving world in Destiny.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##New Threads\n\nWe have a new item from [Bungie Rewards](https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/rewards/) available to anyone brave enough to defeat the new dungeon before the end of the season.

This bug allows players to equip all of the current seasonal Charged with Light armor mods on any of the Season of the Worthy armor pieces without having previously acquired them. While this bug will be fixed in Hotfix 2.9.0.1, the team has decided not to disable the mods until then to allow players to try out the mods for this week.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###UPCOMING RESOLVED ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;Below is a list of issues that will be resolved with Hotfix 2.9.0.1:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The **Guardian Angel artifact armor mod** is not granting its perk when the mod is slotted.\n&gt;* The **Breach Resonator artifact armor mod** is not granting its perk when the mod is slotted.\n&gt;* On **controllers**, Sprint will cancel if players press the Sprint action again.\n&gt;* Players will a full engram inventory of **Umbral Engrams** may be blocked from completing the Season of Arrivals opening quest.\n&gt;* Visible holes are present in the **EDZ terrain** where the Seraph Towers used to be.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###BEYOND LIGHT PRE-ORDER ITEMS ON XBOX\n&gt;\n&gt;In order to receive their pre-order bonus items players who have purchased the Destiny 2: Beyond Light or Destiny 2: Beyond Light + Season pre-order bundles on XBOX need to manually download the \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Pre-Order Pack\u201d.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who have purchased the Destiny 2: Beyond Light Deluxe Edition pre-order bundle on XBOX will need to manually download both the \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Pre-Order Pack\u201d and the \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Exotic Emote\u201d\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* From the Xbox dashboard, highlight the Destiny 2 image\n&gt;* Select \u201cManage game &amp; add-ons\u201d\n&gt;* Navigate to the \u201cReady to install\u201d section on the left\n&gt;* \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Pre-Order Pack\u201d should appear on the right. For Deluxe Edition owners, \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Exotic Emote\u201d should also be listed.\n&gt;* Select \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Pre-Order Pack\u201d on the right, then select Install\n&gt;* Deluxe Edition owners should also select \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Exotic Emote\u201d on the right, then select Install\n&gt;* Wait for the console to report the DLC is installed\n&gt;* Start Destiny 2, and visit the Cryptarch in the Tower to acquire all pre-order items.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Some players who have already pre-ordered may run in to an issue where the Pre-Order Pack and Exotic Emote are not showing in the \u201cready to install\u201d section. For those players, these are the next steps:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Open the Microsoft Store app and navigate to the specific bundle they purchased\n&gt;* Select the \u201cInstall\u201d button. This shouldn\u2019t take long, it\u2019s no more than ~30 MB\n&gt;* \u201cReady to install\u201d for Destiny 2 in \u201cMy games &amp; apps\u201d should now be populated with the missing DLC.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If re-installing the bundle doesn\u2019t populate \u201cready to install\u201d, players should try these steps:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Open the Microsoft Store app\n&gt;* Search for \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Pre-Order Pack\u201d and select it from the search results\n&gt;* On the product page, select Install\n&gt;* For Deluxe Edition owners, repeat the above steps for \u201cDestiny 2: Beyond Light Exotic Emote\u201d\n&gt;* Wait for those download(s) to complete and then try the game again\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The **Almost Mighty Exotic Ghost Shell** and the **Saint's Vocation Exotic ship** appear invisible.\n&gt;* The **Tommy's Matchbook catalyst quest** has been removed from player inventories.\n&gt;* The **Destiny 2: Beyond Light pre-order emblem** does not appear in the Collections.\n&gt;* **Amanda Holliday** has two Legendary ships in her inventory that can\u2019t be purchased.\n&gt;* **Console players** may experience blacked out emblems, invisible ships, and a Power Level of 0 in orbit.\n&gt;* Dying to Environmental Hazards or The Architects will sometimes show a **recommended Power Level** of 1880947200.For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

If you\u2019re new here, Movie of the Week is where we highlight videos we like from the community. All videos below will guarantee their creators a special emblem. If you win, just make sure you have your Bungie.net profile linked in the description.\u00a0\n\n\nHere are the winners!\n\n\n**Movie of the Week**: Horses in the Back\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/x-zJDOadh0A)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention**: Close Call\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/ofG71JNyXAc)\n\n\nWhat a week! Explosions, videos, reveals - oh my! We covered a lot this week, but there is much, much more to do.

We hope you enjoyed the reveal and we\u2019re once again eagerly awa[i](https://i.imgur.com/XaPhczO.jpg)ting getting to watch you experience what we\u2019ve been working on \u2013 both in Season of

ready for departure.\n\n\nBefore we talk about anything else, we\u2019d like to maintain your focus on the events unfolding around the world. You may have seen demonstrations in your town, or like many of us here, down the street from the place you call home.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/136/136209/Bungie_BlacklivesMatter_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fuXrGY0.jpg)\n\n\n* [https://blacklivesmatter.com/\u00a0](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)\n* [https://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/\u00a0](https://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/ )\n* [https://antiracismcenter.com/\u00a0](https://antiracismcenter.com/ )\n* [https://eji.org/\u00a0](https://eji.org/ )\n* [https://www.colorlines.com/](https://www.colorlines.com/)\n\n\nSupport does not end with a single statement or action. We\u2019ll continue to use our games and our shared voice to make the world a better place. We hope you\u2019ll join in supporting these efforts by visiting the following resources noted above, and more, by getting directly involved.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/136/136209/Pride_Pin.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/B7Dtcuc.jpg)\n\n\nThis week also kicks off Pride month. If you hadn\u2019t seen the\u00a0[@BungieStore](https://twitter.com/BungieStore/status/1268241212902760448?s=20)\u00a0announcement, our Pride Pins are back in stock. All profits from sales of Bungie's Pride Pin benefit the\u00a0[It Gets Better Project](https://itgetsbetter.org/), which inspires people across the globe to share their stories and remind the next generation of LGBTQIA+ youth that hope is out there, and it will get better. We also have some words from the Bungie Diversity Committee, speaking to the design of the pin:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Diversity Comittee:** Our Pride pin was specifically designed to include black and brown stripes, in an effort to be inclusive and show support for people of color within the LGBTQIA+ community. In that spirit we want to continue our support for all intersectional communities; including LGTBQIA+ individuals who are also part of the Black community currently fighting against racial oppression, demanding justice and equality. We can support the Black Lives Matter movement and the LGBTQIA+ community at the same time, because without the leadership and heroism of Transgender Black and Brown individuals, like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, today's LGBTQIA+ rights would not exist. And so now is a time to do more to help both, rather than dividing our efforts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf you snag a pin, you\u2019ll also receive a code for the True Colors Emblem to show your support in-game when playing Destiny 2.\n\n\n\n* [Bungie Store](https://bungiestore.com/products/pride-collectible-pin)\n* [Bungie Store EU](https://eu.bungiestore.com/collections/frontpage/products/pride-collectible-pin)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Pride.jpg)\n\n\nWe\u2019ll continue sharing Bungie initiatives to support LGBTQIA+ communities throughout the month of June, so stay tuned. Our commitment to racial justice is just getting started, so you can expect to hear more soon.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nWithin Destiny 2, you may have been watching the approach of the Almighty. You\u2019re itching to see the conclusion of the Season, but you\u2019re also starting to hear whispers of what\u2019s coming next.

Let\u2019s take a quick moment to look through some of the changes.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Eververse**\n&gt;\n&gt;A few TWAB\u2019s back, we talked about the future of Eververse, and how we\u2019re making changes to some reward structures to better balance gameplay rewards with Eververse content. Season of [REDACTED] will contain a few introductory changes, with more shifts coming in Season 12. The following changes will become available next week:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Legendary Armor Ornaments\n\n\n   * As noted in a [previous TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49002), we have shifted the Season 11 armor offering to be a gameplay reward for aspirational content.\n   * The Season of Opulence \u201cIntrepid\u201d Ornament sets are returning to the storefront.\n* Season Pass\n\n\n   * Added an additional 2300 Bright Dust to the Season Pass.\n* Bright Dust Purchases\n\n\n   * Added a \u201cFlair\u201d section to feature Shaders and Spawn FX.\n* Highly requested items from previous Seasons will once again be available.\n\n\n   * We\u2019re looking at you, Wishes of Sorrow.\n* We will once again communicate Season 11 Silver-only items at the beginning of the Season.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re expecting to have an update later in Season 11 on further changes to Bright Dust acquisition, so keep your eyes peeled.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sandbox**\n\n\n* The Powerful Friends armor mod will no longer stack. If multiple copies of this mod are equipped, the mods will provide no bonus stats.\n\n\n   * Developer Commentary:\n\n\n      * Only Solar Seasonal mods are intended to stack. No part of Arc mods are intended to have stacking functionality.\n      * Powerful Friends granted +20 to Mobility, which players could leverage to get three stat columns to the max of 100 points. The mod is not priced sufficiently to justify its benefits, and increasing its cost would have adverse effects on its primary benefit usage.\n      * Season 11 introduces a new Arc mod, granting a similar stat bonus to Strength and will not stack.\n* Enhanced Auto Rifle Loader, Enhance Fusion Rifle Loader, and Enhanced Bow Loader armor mods now have a chance to drop from pinnacle mod sources.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Raid Rewards**\n&gt;\n&gt;The following raid Exotics now have increased drop chances:\n\n\n* One Thousand Voices\n* Anarchy\n* Always on Time (Exotic Sparrow from secret chest in Scourge of the Past)\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**NOTE:** Drop chance begins at 10% and increases to a max of 50% over 20 clears.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Trials Rewards**\n\n\n* Additional Masterwork material rewards now drop at 3, 5, and 7 Trials wins.\n* Added a Trials weekly bounty which unlocks Trials Engrams on Saint-14.\n\n\n   * The bounty reward will match the Win 3 Milestone reward of the week.\n* Trials Tokens distribution has been rebalanced to focus on wins 3, 5, and 7 of a Trials Passage.\n\n\n   * This includes repeat Passages.\n* Trials Tokens are no longer awarded from match completions.\n\n\n   * Tokens are now granted specifically through wins and bounties.\n* Passage of Wealth now doubles the bonus Trials Tokens earned at 3, 5 and 7 Trials wins.\n\n\nHope you enjoyed this appetizer. Full course (and more) coming on June 9. See you then.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Mixing a Green Thumb with a Bumper Jumper\n\nSo, we heard you like patch note previews. They\u2019re short, sweet, and to the point. This topic, though, needs a bit more time to get through. Today, **Staff Designer Lisa Brown** takes center stage to walk us through the upcoming Controller Remapping feature that the team has been working on.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Lisa:** Greetings, Guardians! I\u2019m Lisa, a staff designer on the sandbox team here at Bungie, and I\u2019m going to give an overview of the controller remapping feature for gameplay actions that will be coming to Destiny for all players in the Season of [REDACTED].\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Although we have controller presets in Destiny, these aren\u2019t enough to meet basic accessibility guidelines for motor control and mobility. We\u2019ve been working with some amazing accessibility consultants \u2013 Cherry Rae Thompson ([https://www.cherryrae.com/](https://www.cherryrae.com/)) and Ian Hamilton ([http://ian-hamilton.com/blog/](http://ian-hamilton.com/blog/)) \u2013 to create support for remapping buttons on the controller. Here, I\u2019ll give an overview of how to use the feature, what it can and can\u2019t do, and then share some setups that have been used by various Bungie employees as examples. As a quick note, all of the below examples will be shown using Xbox button layouts.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Overview**\n&gt;\n&gt;Players can create a custom controller layout by going to the Controller section of the Settings screen and choosing Button Layout. A \u201cCustom\u201d option is available in the list.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/136/136209/01_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hXewEnL.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On this screen you\u2019ll be able to customize mappings for gameplay actions on your character, in vehicles, and in general settings (like emotes and interacting with prompts).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/136/136209/05_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1Z3SEoz.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you\u2019re like me and you typically use a preset other than Default, you can use the \u201cReset\u201d button to start from one of those presets.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/136/136209/02_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fQ7YMEp.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To rebind a button, select the button mapping next to the action you want, and the next screen will allow you to input the button you want to remap to.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/136/136209/03_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/WqxTu9S.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Verbs, Verbs, Verbs**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;One of the challenges with controller remapping in Destiny is that we have a LOT of player verbs. Think of verbs as actions \u2013 throwing grenades, triggering your Super, jumping, sprinting, sliding, etc. With PC remapping, there\u2019s a whole keyboard at your disposal to map buttons. On the controller, though, there\u2019s only so many buttons, and we have many more verbs than buttons.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To solve this, we allow the player to map an action not just to a button, but also a type of input. Our three supported input types are:\n\n\n* **Press** \u2013 a standard button press (for example, crouching on the default layout).\n* **Long Press** \u2013 requires holding down the button for a brief period of time to initiate the action (for example, casting Barricade or Rift as a Titan or Warlock).\n* **Double Press** \u2013 pressing a button twice in succession to initiate an action (for example, dodging for Hunters).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;As an example, some of our Exotic weapons (Borealis, Symmetry, Hard Light, etc.) have an alternate weapon action, which has typically been activated by holding the reload button. Now this can be mapped separately, to a different button or different input. For example, I like to change it from long press X to double press X. Now when I want to switch Symmetry\u2019s firing mode, I double press the X button.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the Double Press input type, you can also increase the amount of time between button presses for it to register as a double press. This option is on the main controller page.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/136/136209/04_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TC6G5k2.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Chord Support**\n&gt;\n&gt;In addition to mapping actions to an individual button, we also support mapping to Chords, meaning two buttons pressed simultaneously. In the default layout in Destiny, pressing the Left and Right Bumpers together to execute your Super is an example of a Chord.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here\u2019s a custom layout example where a player has mapped some of the basic character options to just the face button using Chords:\n\n\n* Fire: X\n* Toggle Zoom: Press Y\n* Reload: Press A + X\n* Alternate Weapon Action: Long press A + X\u00a0\n* Melee: Press B + Y\n* Grenade: Double Press B\n* Super: Press A + B\n* Jump: Press A\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Constraints and Caveats**\n&gt;\n&gt;Although this feature is a step towards greater motor accessibility in Destiny, it is still limited in what it can do. For example:\n\n\n* This controller remapping feature is limited to gameplay actions, not UI input or menu navigation.\n* One motor accessibility challenge are inputs that require the player to hold down a button. We have options to switch between holds and toggles for some of our actions (zoom, sprint, crouch) but we were not able to address all cases (examples: weapon firing, class jump ability, charging grenades, drawing a bow, etc.)\n* We opted for flexibility in allowing players to map any action to any button and input combination, but that flexibility means there are some combinations that may give unexpected results for the player.\n* Example: if you map melee to press X, and some other action to Long Press X, the melee action resolves before the duration to detect a long press, so the player would always melee and never do the other action.\n* There is no individualized error verification for these cases.\n* This update was just focused on controller remapping, so there are some mappable options that appear here that are not yet available for keyboard remapping (for example, individual mappings for different class abilities, and some Warlock abilities like Phoenix Dive or Icarus Dash).\n* Our chord support is for simultaneous press of two buttons only, it does not detect if you press one button, hold it down, and then press another.\n* Unlike our presets, there\u2019s no dynamic controller preview image for the custom layout.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Bungie Examples**\n&gt;\n&gt;Here are a few examples of custom mappings that some of our Bungie players enjoy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I\u2019ll start with my own. I\u2019m typically a Jumper player, but I also have a problem with melee on Right Stick Press. Even though it\u2019s a faster input for my hand to reach, I am a stress-clicker, and many a perfect shot line up has been ruined by a wayward melee. I needed to move my melee action to something more intentional, so I put it on A, and moved Super back up to the Double Bumper Chord. I put player highlight back on right stick press, but made my finisher Double Press A. I also made my alternate weapon action Double Press X instead of Long Press, because I prefer that input.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Another example is from a left-handed player who typically uses Mirror, but wanted a true left-handed experience, and so swapped the function of the face buttons with the d-pad buttons. Actions like reload, jump, crouch, etc. were now on the d-pad buttons, while emotes were mapped to the face buttons.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A third Bungie employee really wanted to recreate a classic Halo experience in Destiny. He started with the default layout and switched zoom to a Toggle on Right Stick, grenade on Left Trigger, melee on B and crouch on Left Stick Press. He then mapped Super to A, jump on Left Bumper, and class ability on Right Bumper. He also chose to leave heavy attack, light attack, and guard (actions only used in third person modes like roaming Supers) mapped to their original Right Trigger, Right Bumper, and Left Trigger mappings.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We hope that this feature will make Destiny more accessible and flexible, but do note that this is but one step on Destiny\u2019s journey to improve accessibility across the game.\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to bring another form of accessibility to Destiny 2, and will be watching as this first iteration goes live.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Last Call\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nCGpkaO.gif)\n\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much closing time.

How time flies, eh? We\u2019ve featured hundreds of creations in this space, and this week had the most individual contributors of any creation we've selected so far. Congrats to all of the Guardians who are taking a W home as Season of the Worthy comes to a close.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Quarantine Guardians**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/Gm1Oc6G9sm0)\n\n\nIf you\u2019re hunting a MOTW Emblem, make sure to submit your video to the [Creations Page on Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations). Link the Bungie.net accounts of anyone who helped in the video description, or we won\u2019t know where to send your prize!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThere are so many important things going on in the world, it\u2019s difficult to maintain focus on much of anything right now. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with friends in Discord servers while hitting weekly milestones, talking to them about their health, thoughts, and feelings concerning current world events. Much of our attention has been on what\u2019s happening right outside our windows. The thing is, this isn\u2019t new. This has been happening since well before many of us were born. It\u2019s time to listen and learn from our neighbors and communities. Check in with your fellow Guardians, friends, and family. Take action to help them out if or when they need it. It\u2019s perfectly OK to press pause, put your controllers down, and focus your attention elsewhere - especially if you're going out there to demand justice and to support the Black community. You may find many of us out there with you in the greater Seattle area. Destiny will still be here when you want to sit down for a few games. It isn't going anywhere.\n\n\nBe well, be safe, and we\u2019ll see you starside.\n\n-Dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id":

have been chasing a Lie. Last week, you began your hunt with Ana, successfully defending Seraph Towers in the Winding Cove, Anchor of Light, and the Rupture (or watched as your fellow Guardians carried the weight\u2026). You burned through a thousand enemies with your trusty Shotgun. Sadly, your quest for answers came to a halt on Sunday evening, all thanks to a faulty door on the Moon\u2019s bunker.\n\n\nEarlier this morning, Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.8.1.3 was released, unblocking your journey in finding truth behind The Lie. While we hate to see a bug ship, we\u2019re excited to right the ship as quickly as possible.\n\n\nNow, we look to what comes next. Season of the Worthy is winding down, which means it\u2019s time for a round of previews from the team. This week, we\u2019re hyper focused on Legendary Engrams and weapon tuning.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Decrypting the Future\n\nLast week, we did a deep dive on how loot will be evolving Season over Season. With the upcoming addition of a Max Power Level to your gear, players have been asking how acquisition methods will be changing. We have a breakdown from the Destiny Dev Team on how we\u2019re keeping the items you earn from Legendary Engrams and core activities relevant during a given Season.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Today we\u2019re going to talk about some changes that are coming in Season 11 to the way the world loot pool works.\u00a0 Because the world pool serves as a baseline of legendary gear that can be earned across different activities, we want to update and refresh it seasonally with meta relevant weapons, some of which were previously exclusive to specific activities like Gambit or Crucible.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This shared pool can also be unwieldy -- if you're looking for a specific roll of a specific weapon, a pool too large can make it statistically challenging to find, much less with the roll you want. Starting in Season 11, it will be curated both for relevance and overall size, to strike a balance between number of rewards and the chance to get a sought-after drop. Every season gear from previous seasons will be added, and any gear that would no longer have a Max Power Level greater than or equal to the current Season cap will be cycled out to ensure that drops are Power relevant in the current Season.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The World Pool for Season 11 will consist of the following weapons:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Uriel's Gift\u00a0\n&gt;* Elatha FR4\u00a0\n&gt;* The Old Fashioned\u00a0\n&gt;* Mos Epoch III\u00a0\n&gt;* Hawthorne's Field-Forged Shotgun\u00a0\n&gt;* Last Hope\u00a0\n&gt;* Timelines' Vertex\u00a0\n&gt;* Interference VI\u00a0\n&gt;* Dire Promise\u00a0\n&gt;* True Prophecy\u00a0\n&gt;* Jian 7 Rifle\u00a0\n&gt;* Enigma's Draw\u00a0\n&gt;* Distant Tumulus\u00a0\n&gt;* Escape Velocity\u00a0\n&gt;* Honor's Edge\u00a0\n&gt;* Gnawing Hunger\u00a0\n&gt;* Arsenic Bite-4b\u00a0\n&gt;* Main Ingredient\u00a0\n&gt;* Outrageous Fortune\u00a0\n&gt;* Truthteller\u00a0\n&gt;* Nature of the Beast\u00a0\n&gt;* Last Perdition\u00a0\n&gt;* Bad Omens\u00a0\n&gt;* Night Watch\u00a0\n&gt;* Toil and Trouble\u00a0\n&gt;* Wishbringer\u00a0\n&gt;* Last Dance\u00a0\n&gt;* Lonesome\u00a0\n&gt;* Long Shadow\u00a0\n&gt;* Steel Sybil Z-14\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you still need a weapon or weapon roll from the current Vanguard, Crucible, or Gambit playlists that isn\u2019t on that list, go grab it now!\u00a0\n&gt;\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Lock and Reload\n\nAlongside the changes to the World Loot Pool, we have some changes coming to Destiny 2\u2019s Sandbox. This week, we\u2019ll be focused on weapons \u2013 specifically perk tuning. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown from the team on what to expect:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Reload Perk Updates\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019ve observed that players lean towards picking perks that increase their damage (e.g. Kill Clip) or reduce weapon downtime (e.g. Outlaw).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The damage perks were adjusted quite a while back, but reload perks still don\u2019t feel like choices. This tuning pass aims to keep them feeling powerful without being so dominant that no other choices seem viable.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First, some information on the stats that impact reload:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Reload Stat: 0-100, and maps onto an archetype-specific reload animation speed.\u00a0\n&gt;* Reload Duration Scale: Most reload perks also apply a small multiplier to the reload animation, so that if reload stat is capped, you still see a small speed bump.\n&gt;* Reload Empty Duration Scale: As above, but only applies if the magazine is empty.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Note that because most weapons have fairly high reload stats, decreasing a reload stat bonus from +100 to +50 will still max out the reload stat most of the time, and so doesn\u2019t slow down the actual reload as much as it seems.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The following perks that alter these reload stats are being updated:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Outlaw \u2013 Slowed this down a little bit.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reload stat from +100 to +50.\n&gt;   * Reload Duration Scale from 0.8 to 0.9.\n&gt;* Feeding Frenzy \u2013 This was strictly better than Outlaw, so we\u2019re changing functionality to be based on number of rapid kills.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Functionality changed to increase reload speed based on number of rapid kills, up to 5.\n&gt;   * With 2 kills, reload speed is equal to updated Outlaw.\u00a0\n&gt;   * With 3+ kills, is faster than Outlaw.\u00a0\n&gt;   * With 4+ kills, is the fastest reload in the game (except Alloy Mag).\u00a0\n&gt;   * Max possible reload duration scale from 0.83 to 0.8.\n&gt;   * Max possible reload stat unchanged at +100.\n&gt;* Rapid Hit \u2013 Gave a huge amount of reload and stability for very little work, front-loaded onto the first precision hit. We have updated it so that it still feels good, but isn\u2019t quite as powerful.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Adjusted stacking bonus to give less benefit for the first hit and more with subsequent hits.\n&gt;   * Max possible reload stat from +100 to +60.\n&gt;   * Max possible reload duration scale from 0.8 to 0.925.\n&gt;   * Max possible stability stat from +50 to +25.\n&gt;* Drop Mag \u2013 Situationally really powerful without a massive drawback, as good as a perk, but in a magazine column.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reload duration scale from 0.85 to 0.9 (just brings it in line with Outlaw).\n&gt;* Field Prep \u2013 Unchanged, but for reference:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reload stat +50.\n&gt;   * Reload duration scale 0.8.\n&gt;* Alloy Mag \u2013 Unchanged, but for reference:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reload empty duration scale 0.6666.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, we\u2019re fixing an issue where perks that grant partial weapon ammo did not respect shot count for burst weapons. This means that these perks will now work correctly on Pulse Rifles, Fusion Rifles, and Burst Sidearms, so these perks will be more common on those weapon archetypes in the future:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Slideways\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Slideshot\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Ambitious Assassin\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Subsistence\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Overflow\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Lead from Gold\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Clown Cartridge\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**General Perk Retuning\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;With opening up space by adjusting reload perks, we also retuned some other, underused perks, based on our internal testing and perk popularity and effectiveness data from our internal analytics.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Dynamic Sway Reduction -- Adds 10 Stability over time in addition to accuracy (this is way more powerful than it sounds).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reduced reticle movement from Stability should now tell players this is working.\u00a0\n&gt;* Pulse Monitor -- Take critical damage and you can quickly switch to your now-fully loaded Shotgun!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Reload amount from 0.35 to 1.0.\n&gt;   * +50 Handling.\n&gt;   * 5% faster swap speed.\n&gt;   * This works on stowed weapons too, which was already the case but makes it a lot more useful.\n&gt;* Hipfire Grip -- Now helps you hit shots closer to ADS ranges, still doesn't affect damage dropoff or magnetism.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * 1.2x aim assist falloff.\n&gt;   * +15 aim assist.\n&gt;   * +1.7 degrees precision hip fire angle threshold.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * By default, when hip-firing a weapon, the center of your reticle must be over a target in order to get a crit, otherwise aim assist will give you a body shot. This change gives you a little leniency, so if the center of your reticle is not directly over a target you will still get the crit if you\u2019re within this angle.\n&gt;      * Has no effect on Sniper Rifles.\u00a0\n&gt;* Sneak Bow -- Actually makes you sneaky now. Stealth buff!\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Now doesn't ping radar when shooting.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**New Perks**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Season, we\u2019ll have new perks rolling exclusively on the Season of [REDACTED] weapons. Additionally, Iron Banner will be receiving two new perks on two reprised weapons. In future Seasons, these perks will begin to roll on other weapons.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we don\u2019t want to spoil the fun of discovering and testing new perks, we will leave you with the names of upcoming Iron Banner perks: Iron Grip and Iron Gaze. We are excited to see the community break these perks down when the new Season begins.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Upcoming Archetype Buffs\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Season, we\u2019re taking a quick pass on a few weapon archetypes that have been underperforming.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Slug Shotguns are underused in PvE, because they require crits to maximize damage, and didn\u2019t reward that precision with higher damage per second.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Slug Shotgun PvE Damage + 30%.\n&gt;* High-Impact Pulse Rifles are underused in Crucible. While they have a very fast optimal TTK, that TTK was very hard to achieve, so we decided to soften that a little.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * High-Impact Pulse Rifle damage per bullet from 21 to 22. This changes it from 6 crits to 5 crits/1 body to kill a Guardian in PvP at most Resilience values.\u00a0\n&gt;* In analytics we see Bows are underused in challenging content, and locally we\u2019ve observed that it feels terrible when a Bow leaves a red bar enemy at low health.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Bow PvE damage VS minors + 10%.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Future Archetype Updates\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019ve been evaluating feedback and our analytics data, and while we\u2019re not done yet, we wanted to touch on three community pain points. Our current goal is to touch on these in Season 12, but we\u2019ll be sure to let you know if plans change.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Sniper Rifles \u2013 Community feedback has been that Revoker and Beloved dominate, and looking at analytics they account for 86% of Sniper Rifle usage in the Crucible \u2013 and if we include other low-zoom Sniper Rifles, the number gets even higher.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * We\u2019re specifically looking at how zoom translates into ease-of-use for Sniper Rifles. We\u2019re investigating changes that make choosing a Sniper Rifle zoom more of an interesting choice.\u00a0\n&gt;* Hand Cannons \u2013 We\u2019re evaluating the Hand Cannon subfamilies.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * As an example, we\u2019re breaking out Aggressive Hand Cannons to let us tune their range independently of the others.\n&gt;* Adaptive Auto Rifles \u2013 Auto Rifles in general are highly represented in Crucible, but generally feel balanced. Adaptive Auto Rifles are a little higher, so we\u2019re looking at them.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * We\u2019re not rolling back the Season 10 buff, but we\u2019re adjusting the tuning a little to give other Auto Rifle subfamilies a chance to shine.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Moving forward, we plan to make more regular weapon balance changes, we\u2019ll have more to share on cadence and scope later.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##In the know\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CzL9GPC.gif)\n\n\nYou may have noticed, @BungieHelp on Twitter is freshly verified.

discovered.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGuardian Games has come to a close. Hunters won the first day, but Titans showed up in force to completely dominate the rest of the event. Warlocks took home the silver, and Hunters still look frabjous.\n\n\nThe final Iron Banner of the Season is also live this week and, along with it, players have discovered a new quest. The community has been tasked with helping Rasputin by completing Seraph Tower events and are currently working to complete the objectives on EDZ, the Moon, and Io.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen feedback that the Tower events are too difficult and that it\u2019s hard to wrangle up enough people to join the cause. We have made some server-side changes to lower the difficulty of the event to help alleviate frustrations and increase your success rate.\u00a0\n\n\nWe made an error when we calculated how many completions were required, so yesterday we introduced bonus multipliers to help the community\u2019s progress and get you all on your way to the next step. You can read more details on the [changes we made here](https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1260677894348521472).\n\n##\n\n***\n\nMax Power Level\n\nBack in February, [Luke spoke about upcoming plans](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48758) for Legendary gear infusion. **The Destiny Dev Team** has more details on how this system is going to work.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: Today we\u2019re going to talk about changes to the Infusion system that are coming to Destiny 2.\u00a0 These changes are going to be visible starting in Season 11 but won\u2019t start impacting your arsenal until Season 12.\u00a0 More on that in a bit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We want the sandbox to feel interesting, exciting, and dynamic, and to evolve in compelling ways over time in the same way that the game evolves. Our weapons are the primary way that players interact with the world, and Season over Season we want players to discover new weapons that feel powerful, have interesting new perks to explore, and power the builds that players craft in new and unexpected ways.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The changes to the Infusion system we\u2019re talking about today are designed to promote the following:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* We want you to more frequently earn and enjoy more powerful and standout gear.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Right now, if a new Legendary weapon isn\u2019t better than the current best-in-class, there is no reason to replace your existing weapon with it.\n&gt;   * If a new Legendary weapon is better than the current best-in-class, we risk power creep, removing challenge from the game, or making the item mandatory/the only option for challenging activities.\n&gt;   * Both above points apply equally to new mods and perks, as well.\n&gt;* Powerful weapons can be era-defining, but eventually those eras need to end so that new eras can begin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * We want strong weapons to have their time in the sun, and whenever possible we want you to expect and prepare for powerful gear to cycle out of the endgame meta.\n&gt;   * We can\u2019t solve this by just making weapons that are always \u201cbetter\u201d than the previous ones. This will steadily lower time-to-kill in both PvP and PvE, until the combat sandbox is neither fun nor tactical.\n&gt;* We also want to foster a gradually evolving meta that regularly promotes experimentation and debate.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * We believe Destiny is at its best when you have new desirable things to pursue and when you have active debates with your clanmates about which of those new things to bring into the new raid, or which is going to be hot in Trials next Season.\n&gt;\n&gt;With those goals stated, let\u2019s break down how the changes will work:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Each **Legendary** weapon and piece of armor will have a Max Power Level it can reach through infusion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * **Exotics will not have a Max Power Level.**\n&gt;* The Max Power Level for these items will be set at the player Power Cap attainable 3 Seasons after its release Season (4 Seasons total).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * This means all Legendary gear has a one-year span of time during which it can be used in activities where being at or near the player Power Cap is important (difficult and Power-enabled activities).\n&gt;* The Max Power Level for these items will be visible in game in Season 11, but no items will be at their Max Power Level at the start Season 11.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * **This means all your gear will be relevant in all activities during Season 11.**\n&gt;   * You\u2019ll be able to see what the Max Power Level is for all your gear, and plan accordingly.\n&gt;* At the start of Season 12, weapons and armor released in Seasons 1-8 will have a Max Power Level at the Season 11 player Power Cap\n&gt;* Gear from Seasons 9, 10, 11, and 12 will all be infusible to new player Power Caps for 1 year after their release.\n&gt;* Weapons and armor from the Last Wish and Garden of Salvation raids, will be granted exceptions and will have a higher Max Power Level\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135620/EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CLTHuRp.png)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Example of how Max Power Levels will be displayed in Season 11\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Those are the basics. But you may have additional questions, such as:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Can I still use gear that has reached its Max Power Level?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * **Yes**. You will always be able to equip and use any piece of gear.\n&gt;   * Reaching the player Power Cap is beneficial, but not strictly required, for most activities in Destiny. You can continue to equip and use all gear in these activities.\n&gt;* **This applies to armor as well as weapons?**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Yes - all Legendary gear that provides Power will have a Max Power Level.\n&gt;   * Starting in Season 12, armor will no longer have a Seasonally rotating fourth mod slot. Instead, there will be a mod slot that accepts mods introduced into the game throughout a full year. We recognize that the current need to replace your armor every two to three Seasons, and hoard armor from past Seasons, is undesirable.\n&gt;   * Transmogrification, which we talked about in the [TWAB last week](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49002), will give you the ability to keep your favorite looks and apply them to new armor pieces with higher Max Power Levels.\n&gt;* When gear drops after its debut Season, what will its Max Power Level be?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * It will have the same Max Power Level as it did in its initial release Season.\n&gt;   * Note, this is different than gear that is re-issued. See next question.\n&gt;* Will gear ever have its Max Power Level updated?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Not directly, but gear can be re-issued in future Seasons.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;   * These re-issued versions will have a new Max Power Level based on the Season in which it is re-issued.\u00a0\n&gt;   * We\u2019re going to experiment with how and when gear is re-issued into the game throughout Year 4.\u00a0 Let us know what you think of the different methods as you experience them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re sure you\u2019ll have more questions that aren\u2019t covered above, so please let us know!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re committed to Destiny 2 continuing to grow and evolve for years to come, and a part of that continued evolution is the curation of an interesting, exciting, and dynamic player sandbox. The introduction of Max Power Level will allow us to create exciting new gear more frequently without significant concerns of permanent power creep, which is unsustainable in any game. This also should open up creative and experimental builds, season over season, while letting you anticipate and prepare for how the sandbox will change over time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Please continue to share your thoughts and feelings about these changes as you get your hands on them.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##[REDACTED] Engrams\n\n\nWe spoke a lot about [rewards last week](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49002), but still have some more juicy nuggets to share with you on some additional plans we have for next Season. Here\u2019s **Creative Lead Robbie Stevens** with the details.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Robbie Steven**s: Hey everyone,\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In Season 11 we\u2019re trying something new with how and where you can earn Seasonal rewards.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;So far, every Season in Year 3 has followed a formula where the Seasonal activity (Vex Offensive, Sundial, Bunkers/Seraph Tower) asks for a significant amount of playtime to earn new rewards. While we believe that new content should be one of the best places to earn new rewards, we also realize that Destiny 2 is a big game and it can be frustrating to have so much of your playtime dictated by and focused solely on Seasonal activities.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;So, in Season 11 Seasonal rewards will drop from completing core activities (Strikes, Crucible, Gambit) as well as basically every other activity in the game, (see the full list detailed below). We want to make engaging with the entire game feel rewarding, and for every play session to give you a chance at earning Seasonal loot. In addition to new rewards, Season 11 also features two returning weapons each from Season of the Undying, Season of Dawn, and Season of the Worthy, for a total of six weapons that are free for all players.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Okay, we\u2019ve talked about some of the places where you\u2019ll earn rewards in Season 11, now let\u2019s talk about how you can influence those rewards to chase god rolls and high-stat armor.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Over the last few Seasons we\u2019ve introduced Weapon Bounties that give you agency to chase specific rewards. While addressing bounty fatigue will be an effort that extends beyond Year 3, for the upcoming Season we\u2019ve moved away from Weapon Bounties as part of that effort. Instead, we\u2019re introducing a new type of [REDACTED] Engram that contains the majority of the Season 11 rewards, and by spending Seasonal currency you can influence the contents of this [REDACTED] Engram.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;To clear up any confusion let\u2019s imagine if we launched this [REDACTED] Engram in Season of the Worthy. Imagine this engram contained all the Season of the Worthy weapons and armor. Now imagine you could take this engram to a Seraph Bunker and spend Seasonal currency to Focus the contents of this engram so it only contains the Seventh Seraph SMG and Shotgun. By focusing [REDACTED] Engrams in Season 11 you can choose your rewards, this includes the ability (once you\u2019ve earned it) to Focus engrams so they only contain Season 11 armor with high-stat packages.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;All free players and Season Pass owners will receive [REDACTED] Engrams while playing Season 11, however only Season Pass owners can access the full suite of Focusing categories in Season 11.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Here is preview of the [REDACTED] Engram focusing categories that all players can access after completing the Season 11 opening quest:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Season 11 Armor Focusing reduces the number of rewards in the engram so it only contains Season 11 armor.\u00a0\n&gt;* Previous Season Weapon Focusing converts the rewards in the engram so it only contains the six weapons that are returning from Season of the Undying, Dawn, and Worthy.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;When Season 11 launches, all players will get three focusing categories and Season Pass owners will have access to an additional 15\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;**List of Activities that Reward [REDACTED] Engrams in Season 11:\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* [REDACTED]\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* [REDACTED]\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Public Events\u00a0\n&gt;* Strikes\u00a0\n&gt;* Gambit\u00a0\n&gt;* Crucible\u00a0\n&gt;* Dungeons\u00a0\n&gt;* Raids\n&gt;* Adventures\u00a0\n&gt;* Nightmare Hunts\u00a0\n&gt;* Forges\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;* Reckoning\u00a0\n&gt;* Menagerie\u00a0\n&gt;* Escalation Protocol\u00a0\n&gt;* Blind Well\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Note**: In addition to the above list, [REDACTED] Engrams have a chance to drop when defeating combatants anywhere in the system, similar to Legendary Engrams. They share the same loot pool as Legendary Engrams and when you hit that loot pool you have a 66% chance to earn a [REDACTED] Engram and a 34% to earn a Legendary Engram.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;We hope this preview of Season 11 gives some insight into how we\u2019re approaching the communities\u2019 feedback in the short term.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Guardian\u2019s Heart\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134835/A_Guardians_Heart_emblem.jpg)\n\n\nEarlier this week, we wrapped our [Guardian\u2019s Heart Charity Initiative](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48946) that had been going strong for the last month. We asked you to help support Direct Relief in their efforts to deliver supplies to hospitals and healthcare workers around the world. Guardians everywhere answered the call in full force and together you raised **$788,923.19**. Smashing our goal of $700k.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019d like to thank everyone who donated, and everyone who volunteered their time to help spread the word by streaming in one of the 39 Bungie Bounties that we put on during the event. It\u2019s been inspiring to watch this community come together once again to make the world a little better during a tough time.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##More Fixings\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/w5WogPv.gif)\n\n\nThe Player Support team is keeping an eye out for any issues players are reporting and have updates on how we are handling them.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###HOTFIX 2.8.1.2\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday, May 19, Hotfix 2.8.1.2 will be available to players.

finish line. But before we dive into our weekly update, here\u2019s a word from **Luke Smith** about a topic on many players\u2019 mind these days: Eververse.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;##Rewards in Destiny 2\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey everyone,\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This week\u2019s update is going to look at some of the changes coming to Destiny 2\u2019s rewards. As you know, rewards for your character come from a variety of places: Playlists where you find random folks to play with, aspirational activities like Raids, Trials, and Dungeons where you form up a Fireteam, and even Eververse, where you sling some Silver or Bright Dust back at us for items you want. However, in today\u2019s Destiny 2, the balance of the game\u2019s rewards is not where we want it to be. To be blunt, there isn\u2019t enough pursuit out in the world. We\u2019re going to fix it.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Let\u2019s get to it.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**All of this and more is planned for Destiny 2 Year 4:\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;##Vanity and Accessory (Ships, Ghosts &amp; Sparrows) Changes\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;We will be adding a Transmogrification feature to Destiny 2.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* This will allow players to turn their Armor into Universal Ornaments.\n&gt;* We plan to allow players to do this with in-game effort OR Silver.\u00a0\n&gt;* This feature is in early development and is expected sometime during Year 4.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Each Season we will deliver an aspirational pursuit for armor. We haven\u2019t done this consistently in Destiny 2.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* This armor will come from activities, not the Season Pass nor Eververse.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * As an example: We removed the Eververse Armor from Season 11 and itemized it into an aspirational activity, because this is the right thing to do for the game.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We are improving the rewards for Aspirational Activities (Raids, Trials, Dungeons)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Going forward, Aspirational Activities will reward players with power, items, and vanity.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * When we build an Aspirational Activity it will have at least one accessory to pursue.\u00a0\n&gt;* The team is working on Adept Weapons for Trials of Osiris.\n&gt;* Trials will get new Armor (aka not reprisal), accessories, and weapons in Season 13.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Trials will get new Armor every year.\u00a0\n&gt;* Destiny\u2019s next Raid will have brand new Armor, Weapons, and Exotic Accessories to pursue (no spoilers).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Beginning in Season 12, we will no longer be selling ships, ghost shells, sparrows, or armor ornaments in Eververse that are visually based on themes from Aspirational Activities.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* We are not planning on changing existing items as that is time we could be spending on itemizing the future.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;##Core Playlist Rewards changes (Strikes, Gambit, and Crucible)\n&gt;\n&gt;We are adding a new set of Armor for the core playlists (Strikes, Gambit, and Crucible).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* This armor shares a set of new geometry, with decals and shaders specific to the activity.\u00a0\n&gt;* We will create new sets like this each Year (e.g., Year 4, Year 5, Year 6, etc.)\u00a0\n&gt;* This set will arrive alongside the next Expansion.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Starting in Season 12, we are adding a new Pursuit Weapon each Season.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* This weapon can be earned by playing your preferred Core playlist.\n&gt;* This weapon will have activity-specific Legendary Skins that can be unlocked in each playlist.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**We will no longer be selling new Legendary Weapon Ornaments in Eververse**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;##Dust and Engrams.\n&gt;\n&gt;We are making it easier for you to earn Bright Dust.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* We will be moving away from character-specific ways to earn Bright Dust and more toward Account-specific paths.\u00a0\n&gt;* This change is geared toward giving one-character players significantly more Bright Dust than they earn today.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re updating the Bright Engram to be more relevant than it is today.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The earned Bright Engram in the Season Pass will be updated to include various Year 3 Eververse items previously sold for Silver and Bright Dust. And going forward, that Bright Engram will update each Season to include Eververse items from 3+ seasons prior.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On behalf of all of us at Bungie, we hope you and yours are safe and well. We know you could be doing anything with your free time, and so, so many of you are spending it in our worlds. Thanks, and stay safe.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;See you soon,\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;-Luke Smith\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;And now back to your regularly scheduled TWAB!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Nearing the finish line\n\nLook, you know it. I know it. Titans have taken a stand, owning the Guardian Games since Day 2 of the event. They\u2019ve held strong against the book-reading Warlocks. They laugh in the face of fashion-centric Hunters like myself. After years of taking a backseat and avoiding the spotlight, Titans are showing off their Light brighter than they ever have before.\u00a0\n\n\nThe more I think about this, the less surprised I am. Going into the event, I knew Titans would show up\u2026 maybe not to this extent, but Titans always have a way of being there when you need them. Day in and day out, Titans are standing strong in the face of darkness to protect the citizens of the Last City. Even if I was hoping for more Hunter wins, I can\u2019t help but acknowledge the unrelenting strength here. Good stuff, Titans. You all deserve a bit more credit than folks give you.\n\n\nWe still have a few days left of this event, all contributing two points to daily standings. Warlocks, Hunters\u2026 these are your last chances to make a statement. Will you swap placements before the end of the games, or have you embraced your second and third place standings, respectively? Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the rest of this week\u2019s topics. Guardian\u2019s Heart is coming to a close, and we have a final list of Bungie Bounty targets for you to hunt in support of charity, as well as a forecast of the final Iron Banner for this season.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Guardian\u2019s Heart Update: Final Week\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134835/A_Guardians_Heart_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hXG423Z.jpg)\n\n\nThe Guardian\u2019s Heart Charity Initiative has entered its final week. If you\u2019ve been following along, we hit our $700,000 goal last week! Knowing this community, though, we aren\u2019t even close to done yet. At the time of writing this article, you\u2019ve already helped raise another $50k to help those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We still have a slew of Bungie Bounties to place on the heads of our community in support of this charity event. Here\u2019s who you\u2019ll be looking for over the next few days:\n\n\nMay 8 - [Phammy](https://twitter.com/PhamTheBanana)\u00a0at 1:00 AM on PC (Australia)\n\nMay 8 - [Benj](https://twitter.com/Benjjjyy) and [PolarBear](https://twitter.com/PolarBearTwitch) at 10:00 AM on PC (UK)\n\nMay 8 - [Kinda Funny](https://twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids) and [What\u2019s Good Games](https://twitter.com/WhatsGood_Games) at 12:00 PM on PS4\n\nMay 9 - [Zoe_](https://twitter.com/Zoe_ttv) at 5:00 AM on PC (UK)\n\nMay 11 - [Jarv](https://twitter.com/Jarvenis) and [HOUNDISH](https://twitter.com/xHOUNDISHx) at 10:00 AM on Xbox (UK)\n\n\n**The Guardian\u2019s Heart Initiative ends at 10:00 AM Pacific on May 12, 2020. If you would like to support this charity initiative and receive the Guardian\u2019s Heart emblem, please [donate $20 or more to the Tiltify page](https://tiltify.com/+bungie-community/guardians-heart) before this deadline!**\n\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone who has donated thus far. I don\u2019t think any of us could have imagined a pandemic like this in our lifetimes. To see Guardians coming together once again to support those in need warms our hearts. Thank you.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Iron Finale\n\nNext week, Lord Saladin returns to the Tower, hosting the final Iron Banner of the season. If you dig 6v6 power-enabled combat, this is your time to shine. Saladin will bring his final round of weekly bounties, each of which rewarding pinnacle power gear. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been striking out on that final Heavy Weapon \u2013 Iron Banner may grant you the Rocket Launcher you need to finish your pinnacle journey for this season.\n\n\nAs this is the final Iron Banner of the season, this serves as last call for a few rewards.\n\n\n\n* Iron Remembrance Armor Sets\n* Cast Iron Emblem\n* Iron Precious Shader\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134835/Iron_Banner_Armor_v480.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FeAlTSV.jpg)\n\n\nAdditionally, this will be your last chance to earn the Point of the Stag Pursuit Bow. This weapon will not be available during Season 11, so get in there and complete your quest! Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll fall in love with a new Bowfriend.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133832/irobnanner_bow.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nBAwsMx.jpg)\n\n\n**Iron Banner and Bonus Valor will be available from 10 AM Pacific on May 12, running through 10 AM Pacific on May 19.\u00a0**\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Bug Bashers\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1Lbl8FS.gif)\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it a thousand times more: The only good bug is a dead one. The Player Support team is vigilant, diving into as many #Help threads as they can each day to diagnose issues, distribute help articles, and find new issues in Destiny 2.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**SMALL FIRETEAM XP BUFF**\n&gt;\n&gt;Fireteams who play together, stay together, which is why it\u2019s important to reward them for their dedication. Earlier this week [Bungie Help tweeted out](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1257405839851139073?s=20) an issue identified with the Season Pass Small Fireteam XP Buff:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;***An issue has been identified with a fix in progress where a small amount of the Season Pass Small Fireteam XP Boosts aren\u2019t always applied to players appropriately. Regular XP Boosts aren\u2019t impacted. Stay tuned to our This Week at Bungie blog post this week for more information.***\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We concluded that, in the worst case scenario, this issue is unlikely to have impacted players more than a single Season Pass rank. We expect to deploy a fix by patch 2.8.1.2 on May 19.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**ERROR CODES**\n&gt;\n&gt;Destiny Player Support is investigating increases in connection-based error codes, including BEAVER, ANTEATER, and RABBIT, with priority set to NEWT and WATERCRESS errors.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As we continue to investigate solutions for players affected by persistent WATERCRESS errors, Destiny Player Support has set up an [investigation timeline](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/255959724?sort=0&amp;page=0) for players to track the progress of our internal investigations into the issue. This thread will continue to be updated with the latest information as it becomes available and until a solution is found.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The **Doom Fang Pauldron** exotic Titan gauntlets gain Super energy inconsistently on Void melee kills.\u00a0\n&gt;* The Warlord\u2019s End perk on **Felwinter\u2019s Helm** exotic Warlock helmet activates inconsistently with melee and Finisher kills.\n&gt;* Performing a Finisher while wearing the **Severance Enclosure** exotic Titan chest piece will not count Finisher kills towards bounties.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).

This week\u2019s MOTW winner took a swing and what the event could look like with specific challenges and score by judges.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week:\u00a0 The Guardian Games**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/SmKpjwaJpIo)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: The Gunslinger**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/jVsPPiao1kY)\n\n\nDo you have good talent and a great editor to make your content shine?

If you\u2019re featured, you\u2019ll receive a shiny new emblem for your troubles.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe end of a TWAB usually means that we\u2019re nearing the end of a Thursday\u2026 which leads to another weekend of Trials. While Trials is a predictable Friday offering, we\u2019ve seen some feedback that things shouldn\u2019t be too predictable.\n\n\n**This week\u2019s Trials of Osiris map will be [Redacted]!**\n\n\nWait, what? Didn\u2019t I confirm that Trials maps were on a set rotation per season? Yeah\u2026 [I totally did](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1256269738256130048?s=20). But that\u2019s the beauty of a live game, things can change. The team has been looking at your feedback daily since Trials launched, and some things are a bit easier to change than others. For the foreseeable future, Trials maps will be on a random rotation. If anything changes with those plans, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\n\n\nHave a good weekend, and we\u2019ll see you again next week.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1469023, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 5/7/2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/gfg5yy/this_week_at_bungie_572020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "collections": [{"author_id": "t2_mocx5", "author_name": "DTG_Bot", "collection_id": "3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "created_at_utc": 1565530291.728, "description": "A list of all This Week At Bungie posts.", "display_layout": null, "last_update_utc": 1588285353.127, "link_ids": ["t3_af25cd", "t3_ah481q", "t3_ajsedl", "t3_alvfka", "t3_ao9wte", "t3_aqpxzn", "t3_at9ul5", "t3_avx91v", "t3_ayk8tz", "t3_b15gjp", "t3_b3wyr2", "t3_b6obl3", "t3_b9k4wk", "t3_bc5jkp", "t3_besokf", "t3_bhe8w9", "t3_bk1cnt", "t3_bmpymm", "t3_bpj5x6", "t3_bs9s8g", "t3_buzcp4", "t3_bxmngp", "t3_c0c9sb", "t3_c311of", "t3_c6bun6", "t3_cc0flf", "t3_cez1le", "t3_chufi1", "t3_ckuatg", "t3_cnreiv", "t3_cqwvcm", "t3_cu4h82", "t3_cx5ul9", "t3_d07vph", "t3_d3eovr", "t3_d6l8js", "t3_d9rjjg", "t3_dcy6rk", "t3_dg5pwn", "t3_djdrul", "t3_dmnqin", "t3_dptooj", "t3_dt5x25", "t3_dwhjnh", "t3_dzqtrz", "t3_e21qrm", "t3_e6oqhs", "t3_e9u6k8", "t3_ed20nj", "t3_emho4d", "t3_eprd61", "t3_et16vp", "t3_ewe159", "t3_f00num", "t3_f3iarh", "t3_f73765", "t3_famkx4", "t3_fe3vsc", "t3_fhp0em", "t3_flitev", "t3_fpknrx", "t3_ftvz1z", "t3_fy0z6p", "t3_g2p1gk", "t3_g6vaix", "t3_gb5ppk"], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/collection/3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "title": "This Week At Bungie"}], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1588285352, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/gb5ppk/this_week_at_bungie_4302020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gb5ppk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_css_class": "bungie", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Bungie"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2f13ba30-3d46-11e9-8cd7-0e03d8e4b5da", "link_flair_text": "Bungie", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1539, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/gb5ppk/this_week_at_bungie_4302020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "PcQqnl4qm4Q6Q27I4gM_-h6xLjKzLx77IiqqBHjAl98", "resolutions": [{"height": 42, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/x1rbBdH0S6msglME9c_SMOVo-HAR__7ca6Bbf2NJOmY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d595f90abb9b575b2ad3dea8b3f01888555a7a2d", "width": 108}, {"height": 84, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/x1rbBdH0S6msglME9c_SMOVo-HAR__7ca6Bbf2NJOmY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5293a69c3514b779371af98631e39bc55a777a4", "width": 216}, {"height": 125, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/x1rbBdH0S6msglME9c_SMOVo-HAR__7ca6Bbf2NJOmY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95d01ff8f5c89ad84e53120f376be27e505f0c4", "width": 320}, {"height": 251, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/x1rbBdH0S6msglME9c_SMOVo-HAR__7ca6Bbf2NJOmY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ca3c704f3da9f008396f97fb3bc371f83cc7fa7", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/x1rbBdH0S6msglME9c_SMOVo-HAR__7ca6Bbf2NJOmY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a46a1c81c3e1f313d00d347f8ad0527080d7e3bf", "width": 814}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1588285358, "score": 1, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48993\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, Titan domination continues.\n\n\nGuardian Games continues into its second week and, after a good showing by Hunters on Day 1, it\u2019s been all Titans all day every day. The book readers haven\u2019t scored a win yet, but are optimistic they can rally.\n\n\nAfter Day 1, we saw a lot of players asking about score weighting since the results seemed to play out like the population of classes predicted. Since Titans have been relentlessly destroying the other classes, we have seen players asking if there may be some other issue going on. As a Hunter, I too am in disbelief as I watch our flag try to bury itself into the ground. We\u2019ve been double checking behind the scenes and digging into the data to get a better picture of what\u2019s going on. Here is **Senior Designer** **Peter Sarrett** to share some of our findings.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Peter Sarrett**: When we first started planning Guardian Games, we knew there were more Hunters than other classes in the population and we\u2019d have to do something to account for that so that the competition would be fair. \u201cFair\u201d can mean different things. Our goal was that each class should have an equal chance to win regardless of its size, and that participating in the event should never hurt your team.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That last part is important, because it ruled out the simplest approach of basing results on the average contribution per class. While this would effectively normalize the classes based on how many people participate, it would also create a situation where participating at anything but a maximal level could actually HARM your team by bringing its average down. Dipping your toe into the event by depositing a single bronze medal per day would be worse for your team than just staying home.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;So instead of normalizing based on participating players, we decided to normalize based on the pool of **potential** players. For each class, we counted every character who played at least one activity over the 30 days prior to the event and then divided that result by the total across all three classes. The result is the scaling factor that we apply to each medal deposited. This method means that medals from Warlocks and Titans count more, counteracting Hunters\u2019 population advantage, and ensures that even a minimal level of participation helps your team. The more members of your class that show up to play, the better your class will do. It also means we don\u2019t have to worry about players creating tons of dummy alt accounts once the event begins to try to tank a team\u2019s chances.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Day 1 of the event, Hunters won not simply because there are more of them, but because a greater percentage of them showed up and contributed. On Day 2 Titans arrived and began outperforming the Hunters. Warlocks are, no doubt, considering all the angles and planning for the right moment to strike.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This graph shows how many of each class actually participated, relative to how many characters each class had active during the prior 30 days of the event beginning. You can see the tight correlation between more bodies in the game and the outcome of the competition:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135441/ParticipationDelta-_004_.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CBKGAGD.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;But that\u2019s not the whole story. Titans haven\u2019t just been overwhelming the competition with a flood of muscle mass. They\u2019ve also been out-depositing the other classes on an individual basis. On average, each Titan has contributed more medals to their cause than each Hunter or Warlock. This was even true on Day 1 but, on that day, there were enough Hunters participating that they made up in bodies what they lacked in output.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135441/PointsPerCharacter-_004_.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GllrI8E.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;So we can see that Titans are outperforming on two fronts: a higher percentage of their ranks are showing up to participate, and when they do, each of them is depositing more medals than their competitors. If Hunters or Warlocks up their game and get more of their compatriots to pitch in, there\u2019s still time to steal the momentum.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019ve seen the reports of shenanigans with players finding glitches to turn in more medals, or even be dedicated enough to delete characters to be able to put in extra medals for their team. We dug into the data to see if this was something to be concerned about and found **neither case was having any impact on the results.\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s also worth mentioning how the flags in the Tower work. At the start of the day, all the teams are even and so the flags begin at the midpoint of their poles. This represents equilibrium, where all teams have an even 33.33 percent of all accumulated points for the day. As medals get deposited and teams move away from equilibrium, the flags adjust. We expected that teams would stay fairly close to each other, and that all the action would occur in a narrow band around the equilibrium point. If a team ever pulls 5 percent ahead (with a total of 38.33 percent or more of all points), their flag will hit the top of their pole. Likewise, a team dropping 5 percent behind (at 28.33 percent or less) will hit the bottom of their pole. If a team goes beyond these values, their flag will just stay pegged at the top or bottom until the values come back into that +/- 5 percent window.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We don\u2019t plan on making any changes that will affect the results in any way. Our goal has always been to create a competition that is decided by how much each class engages with the event, and not which class has the largest roster. Titans are currently engaging the most, but we will see if they keep it up.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Evolving Seasons\n\n[Last week, ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48973)we touched on upcoming Trials of Osiris changes and how we are tackling cheating issues in Destiny 2. This week we want to talk about our Seasonal model and some improvements we are working on to make it better. Here is one of our **Creative Directors Evan Nikolich** to share details on what to expect.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Evan Nikolich**: Hey everyone,\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019ve collected lots of great feedback over the last several months about our Seasonal model. [Luke outlined some of our thinking back in February,](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48758) and today we want to look at how that vision is guiding action in Destiny 2, Year 4.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###The Story Continues\n&gt;\n&gt;We have been making progress carrying the overarching narrative Season over Season in Destiny 2. Saint-14 and Osiris led to the Warmind which leads to\u2026 **[REDACTED]**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s not perfect yet. The bridges between Seasons can definitely be improved, and we could do a better job of recognizing prior Seasons\u2019 narrative threads in the active Season.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In Year 4, we are going to build a better interconnected narrative and, more importantly, let players be a part of that narrative no matter when they enter the current year. This means if you start playing in March 2021, you could go back and experience the Season 12 and Season 13 narrative content. We want our stories to feel more cohesive, flow with meaningful momentum Season over Season, and lead to an exciting climax each year.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That said, for a narrative to have weight, there needs to not only be meaningful change but also a meaningful way to experience the history of the world.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We haven\u2019t preserved enough history for a player who comes in mid-year to have any concept of what came in that year\u2019s prior Seasons. As a result, players can feel left behind later in the year and unable to experience the stories or to acquire prior Seasons\u2019 weapons and gear. The Forsaken Season Pass allowed its content to build up over the course of the year, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading in Year 4.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Activities will last the entire year\n&gt;\n&gt;Beginning in Season 12, the core parts of the activity experience will live on after the Season has ended. For late players joining in future Seasons, we want to give you the opportunity jump straight into the heart of the older activity experiences without all of the previous Season-specific requirements. We want to remove any competing and distracting elements with the new active Season, which has its own ritual progression, but the actual activity experience stays.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Let me give an example of how this might work in the future using Season of Dawn to illustrate. With our new approach, when Season of Dawn concluded we would have left behind the \u201cSaving Saint-14\u201d quest, the Exotic quests to acquire Devil\u2019s Ruin and Bastion, and the Sundial activity. We would sunset the Obelisks experience to reduce clutter in the quest log and to keep bounty quantity from inflating across the game, and deprecate the Fractaline currency so it could be safely removed from the player\u2019s inventory. The Obelisks were time intensive and we do not want to overload a player\u2019s choices in engaging in the current Seasonal ritual versus the past Seasonal ritual. This is our current plan for Year 4 but, like everything else, these plans and exactly how content persists will change and evolve as we work.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Destiny 2 will still have moments woven into the overall universe narrative where we remove old content and allow for new content and stories to grow in its place. As we\u2019ve said in the past, we cannot continue to grow the Destiny universe infinitely. There\u2019s lots of reasons for this \u2013 technical, resourcing, as well as from an overarching universe design standpoint. Finding the balance of creating and maintaining content in our ongoing narrative is a necessary part of continuing to build on Destiny 2.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Rewards Remain\n&gt;\n&gt;With the Seasonal activities persisting, a player will need a good reason to go play them. The reason is in the rewards and we are planning on carrying a Season\u2019s rewards forward throughout the year. In today\u2019s Destiny 2, history is expressed by the things you have collected. We want players to be part of that chase no matter when they enter the year and to reduce the pressure to collect everything during a single Season. In the short term to acknowledge this step forward we are taking, we are adding **some selected weapons** from Seasons 8, 9, and 10 to an engram that will drop during Season 11.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Long term, we want to make sure that the rewards we release each Season are available to players throughout the year. Continuing with our Season of Dawn example, the rewards that came out of Sundial would continue to drop from Sundial. How the drops will occur will change (as, narratively, Osiris has left and we have removed the Obelisks), but weapons and gear would still be present. This is the obvious solution, but it suffers from a design perspective in creating a narrow pursuit focus. Having the rewards in just one location oversimplifies the pursuit game and has the same effect of limiting the ways you can play Destiny.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Our focus is to broaden and provide multiple ways for you to earn past Seasons\u2019 rewards. In addition to the rewards coming from the Seasonal activity, we are thinking of having the Seasonal rewards be available to earn in the core modes of play as well (Strikes, Crucible, and Gambit). If you\u2019re getting tired of playing Sundial, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to jump into Crucible or Strikes and pick up a couple of the Season of Dawn weapons we\u2019ve handpicked. As the Seasons roll on, the rewards will continue to get added to these core activities and, as a player, you can tackle the pursuits at your own pace in your preferred mode of play and feel the world growing in terms of rewards.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To summarize, we\u2019re going to move toward Seasons that can be experienced all year. The Destiny experience should grow each year after an expansion, have a meaningful evolving world, and a bunch of reasons to play. And then each year, we should take a step forward into a new expansion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019ve done this better in the past and we\u2019re going to mine from that going forward to make our future Seasons that much more compelling. There will be much, much more Year-4 talk in the coming months.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Bounty Hunters\n\nLast week, we also told you we would address the growing concerns with the role bounties play in the game and what our plans are to make changes. Here is **Design Lead Tyson Green** to tell you more.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Tyson Green**: Bounties have come to be a central mechanic for any repeatable activity content in Destiny, so much so that we've seen them move towards being mandatory chores rather than opportunities to optimize. We have some changes coming to help bring things back into balance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Shifting Away From Weekly FOMO\n&gt;\n&gt;XP and Season Rank gains are currently balanced around large contributions from Weekly Bounties. The intent here was to provide a large amount of progress for a small amount of focused play every week, but Weeklies fall down here because you lose out on big chunks of progress if you miss a week, and they are strained between too little progress for single-character players and too much repetitive work for triple-character players.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While the specifics are still under development, as early as Season 12 we want to make this better by replacing Weekly Bounties with a mechanism that provides players with a set of non-expiring and account-scoped objectives each week that grant lots of Season Rank progress (more than the Weeklies they replace). That way the return on effort is better, more consistent between players.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Optional XP Optimization, Not Critical Path\n&gt;\n&gt;Bounties have found their way into the critical path of some Seasonal pursuits, becoming primary sources for Seasonal progress. Starting in Season 12, we plan to steer away from this model in general. Bounties should focus on being an optional way to optimize for more or faster core progressions, like XP or Powerful gear by way of Challenges.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When it comes to optimization, we recognize that there is a very blurry line between \"optional\" and \"mandatory\", and there's no perfect balance that works for everyone. But we think the balance is tilted too far towards feeling like you need to do bounties to unlock Seasonal content, so we're going to take this step to tilting back.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Event Bounties\n&gt;\n&gt;Our Seasonal free events are also currently heavily utilizing bounties in their design. We have seen the feedback around Guardian Games being the most recent source of frustration, with too much emphasis on completing bounties to participate in the event. We don\u2019t plan on making any changes to the current event as it\u2019s ending in a few weeks, but are already looking at plans to adjust the role bounties will play in future events.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###QOL Improvements\n&gt;\n&gt;We don't like that every play session starts with 10-15 minutes of loading up on bounties. We want to make it easier to grab bounties when you want to do them. To that end, we are looking at mechanisms like allowing bounties to be accessed directly from the Destination Map. These are a bit further out (think Season 13), but are on our roadmap.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We also don't like it when a bounty you\u2019ve nearly completed in the middle of the previous day's play session expires right in the middle of today's session. While we still see expiration as a necessary mechanism to keep half-completed bounties from hanging around forever, we're going to relax some of the expiration times in Season 11 to give more time to close out yesterday's \u201c19 out of 20 grenade kills.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Speaking of grenade kills, in general we're dialing in the time to complete bounty objectives to be more consistent. Unexpectedly time consuming objectives sneak in from time to time, and we generally want objectives in upcoming Seasons to be a bit less restrictive in terms of how you play.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Guardians to The Rescue\n\nThe Bungie Foundation is our way of making the world a better place.

We kicked off the event with a dev insight showing some of us at Bungie sharing our thoughts on who is going to win.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqeun_aBkz4)\n\n\nSure, there\u2019s some light-hearted ribbing going on, but at the end of the day we\u2019re all Guardians. Still though, the winners get to flex their class item in everyone\u2019s faces, so get out there and represent your team.\n\n\nHunters won the first day, but Titans rose to the occasion to claim day two. It\u2019s still far from over. One thing we haven\u2019t told you yet is that during the final week of the event, every day\u2019s victory will count for double points. So if any class is holding a fairly significant lead and thinks they can sit back and relax, they better keep on pushing or another class could pull off a comeback.\n\n\nBefore we move on to the rest of the TWAB, **Production Director Justin Truman** would like to speak on the current state of the game and our plans going forward.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Justin Truman**: Hey everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re playing a lot more video games now than you did last month. In these uncertain times, we want Destiny to be a satisfying escape rather than a frustrating grind.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There\u2019s been a growing list of concerns with the game lately: Trials, the rise in cheaters, our new Seasonal model, the balance between rewards you earn vs. items you buy. We\u2019ve been closely watching and discussing each of these topics as we read your feedback. When our community managers relay that everyone at Bungie is listening, I assure you, we are.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re also working hard from our homes, trying to address and improve each of these areas for future releases. Nothing in Destiny is as easy as flipping a switch, and everything\u2019s gotten trickier while working remotely. But as Destiny players ourselves, we struggle with the same issues you do, and we want to fix them as quickly as we can.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;But fixing these issues isn\u2019t good enough if we keep you in the dark the whole time, so we\u2019re going to try something a little different. Every week for the rest of this Season, we\u2019ll have updates from different members on the dev team covering the most important topics in Destiny right now, and what we\u2019re planning to do about them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Today we\u2019re going to discuss Trials and our war against cheaters.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Next week we\u2019ll be diving deep on our Seasonal model, and how we plan to improve it in the future as well as some info on bounties and our plans involving their evolution.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We have plans for future editions of the TWAB, but we also want to hear from you. What are other topics you want to make sure we discuss in the coming weeks?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Like you, we love Destiny and the community that makes it as special as it is. For a bunch of us, Destiny represents more than a decade of our lives, and we\u2019re never going to stop trying to make it better \u2013 even if we have to do that from our beds and couches in this unprecedented time. I\u2019m looking forward to sharing more with you in the coming weeks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stay safe out there, Guardians.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Trials and Tribulations\n\nA few TWABs ago, [we talked about some of the issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48919) with how the Trials of Osiris rewards are currently set up. We have an update on how we\u2019ll start addressing some of your feedback.\n\n\nOur goal for Trials is to encourage players to chase seven win tickets. Resetting tickets should not be the most effective way to earn Trials gear. Rewards should show players that the further you progress, the better the payout. Players that have already gone flawless once over a weekend should be encouraged to repeat the experience on passages other than Mercy \u2013 to strive to earn more rewards and not sit at the bottom of cards picking on fireteams struggling to hit three wins or even just win a single match.\u00a0\n\n\nTrials has always had a problem of being approachable for players who aren\u2019t highly skilled PvP gods. We believe that players should be encouraged to make an attempt every week, regardless of skill. You should feel some value in dipping your toe in each week to see if you can get a little further than last week, to push yourself to improve and get better. While every single player won\u2019t make it to the Lighthouse, you should feel like you can get meaningful rewards by pushing yourself and still get some rewards for spending time in the activity.\n\n\n**So what are we doing about it?**\n\n\n\n* ***Problem: Token Rewards incentivizes players to farm to three wins and reset their card.***\n\n   * **Solution**: In Season 11 we\u2019re planning on creating token payout milestones at 3/5/7 wins that give successively larger chunks of tokens. Bonus Tokens Passage should increase these payouts, and on a flawless run it will generate a significant token payout.\u00a0\n* ***Problem: Trials is unrewarding for players stuck at 1-2 wins.***\n\n   * **Solution**: Create a weekly bounty that encourages participation each weekend and does not require match wins. When redeemed, the bounty will reward the same item that comes from the three-win passage unlocking the engram for purchase that week.\n* ***Problem: Trials feels unrewarding compared to other endgame activities.***\n\n   * **Solution**: Inject more chances to earn Masterworking materials from Trials. Masterworking/infusion materials will come from 3/5/7 win payouts in Season 11. We\u2019re also looking into possibly adding a new material-focused farming card in Season 12.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThese are our current plans for changes we want to make in the short term. We\u2019re also still investigating improvements we can make in the long term. For example, you may be asking \u201cWhat about Adept weapons?\u201d We\u2019re currently investigating a new form of Flawless aware weapons for a future Season. They might not have the same name, but these weapons would have some differences in order to set them apart. Right now we are currently looking at giving these weapons the ability to replaces the weapon mod slot with an adept mod slot(name may change) that can accept custom-built mods in addition to the normal list of weapon mods. All of this is subject to change as we continue to develop but wanted to give you an early look. We\u2019ll share more details in the future.\u00a0\n\n\nWe know many of you are far more concerned about cheaters ruining your trips to the Lighthouse, and rightfully so. It\u2019s a punch in the gut to lose on your final game to someone with a fully automatic Whisper of the Worm. Let\u2019s now take some time to update you on the cheater war effort.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##No Quarter\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135320/Bungie_Security_NoStrobe_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/H3NcLn0.gif)\n\n\nWhen winning every match is more important than ever, it\u2019s no surprise that there are some who are willing to cheat or pay others to cheat for them. We asked **Destiny Engineering Director David Aldridge** to give an update on the fight for a fair fight.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**David Aldridge**: Let\u2019s talk about cheating.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheating in Destiny 2 is up roughly 50 percent since January, and significantly more in the highest skill echelons. We expected a significant bump with the return of Trials, and we made a number of careful preparations, most notably partnering with Valve to integrate [Steam Datagram Relay](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer/steamdatagramrelay) into our PC build to mitigate DDOS attacks. While many of those preparations were successful (e.g. DDOSing on PC is nearly extinct), we\u2019re still not happy with the amount of cheating happening today, especially in Trials. When your pinnacle achievements are denied by encountering a cheater on a high Trials ticket, or devalued by seeing someone else with ill-gotten goods, that\u2019s frustrating. Those frustrations are happening too often right now, and the vengeance of the Banhammer is often too far behind.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That said, the Banhammer has not been idle. Before Season of the Worthy launched, we were averaging 656 bans or restrictions per week. In the first four weeks after launch, that rate more than tripled to 2133 punishments per week.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When it comes to tracking and punishing cheaters, we have to keep some of our plans and knowledge secret for obvious reasons, but we still wanted to give you a brief overview of the worst types of cheating we\u2019re actively combatting:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* On PC (where most cheating occurs, unsurprisingly):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Memory-poking attacks to gain gameplay advantage (e.g. infinite ammo, infinite ability energy, infinite respawns, teleports)\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * To acknowledge a valid point that we often see come up in community discussion, some of these attacks leverage Destiny\u2019s unique hosting model, discussed here and at much more length here. We designed Destiny\u2019s model to optimize for the feel and consistency of high-complexity, high-action, high-fidelity PvE experiences, while allowing the seamless blending of PvE and PvP. Unfortunately, that model comes with some unique challenges in providing PvP security guarantees. That said, we continue to invest in preventions and detections in this space, leveraging the servers that host and monitor every match. This is a subtle point we\u2019ve struggled to convey over the years: we do have servers hosting every match, but in our hosting model, those servers don\u2019t have complete authority over the game simulation to prevent all of these sorts of attacks naturally. This makes it more difficult (but not impossible) to mitigate these attacks.\u00a0\n&gt;* Aimbots\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * &lt;We have plans to address this problem, but will keep the details close to our vest to prevent further hacks and workarounds.&gt;\u00a0\n&gt;* Wallhacks\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * &lt;Same as above&gt;\u00a0\n&gt;* Lag switching\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * We have detection and banning systems in this area, and we\u2019ll continue to hone those. We want to be cautious here because some players suffer with unreliable internet through no fault of their own and aren\u2019t using it to gain advantage.\u00a0\n&gt;* On consoles:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * DDOS in Trials\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * We have detection and banning systems around this (we\u2019ve been evolving them since the original Destiny) but they\u2019re imperfect because DDOS occurs entirely outside of the machine running the game. One long-term mitigation to this is adopting SDR on consoles as well, which we hope to do at some point in the future.\u00a0\n&gt;   * Lag switching\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * See above.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;But you didn\u2019t come here just to hear us describe the types of cheating in Destiny. The more pressing question is: **What do we plan to do about it?\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **We\u2019re shifting more people to help work on this space.** More eyes analyzing cheater reports, more developments in our anti-cheat systems, more people developing and testing new ban rules, and more fuel for the hammer. There are many details about new detections and preventions, but sharing those would give the bad actors a head start. The one thing I can say is that a big focus is rapid response \u2013 we want to get cheaters out of the pool more quickly. This is key to reducing the value of cheating, especially in selling access to cheats.\n&gt;* **We\u2019re changing a key policy \u2013 fireteammates of cheaters are no longer innocent.** We now reserve the right to restrict or ban any player who has benefitted from cheating, even if they didn\u2019t cheat themselves. This includes scenarios where players group up with or provide account information to a guide or carry service, which then cheats on their behalf. We want you to find new friends out there, but be sure they have your trust before you go. If you LFG your way into a fireteam with a cheater, get out and report them. If you ride them to a flawless, the Banhammer will come for you as well.\n&gt;* **We\u2019re considering requiring a much higher player time investment to play Trials.** We\u2019re interested in your thoughts on this. What if you had to have ~100 hours of play on an account to participate in any Trials match where a ticket with more than four wins was at stake on either side? Increasing the time it takes for a new account to become Trials-ready increases the power of our Banhammer (since cheaters can always create new dummy accounts), but it also adds barriers to honest, law-abiding PvPers that want to check out Trials. Would the reduction in cheaters be worth the increased barrier to getting your T-1000-aimskill buddy who\u2019s running behind on Light to join your fireteam?\n&gt;* **[REDACTED]**. Because this is a cheating discussion, know that we have additional initiatives we do not intend to share publicly, in order to stay one step ahead of attackers.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There are a couple of common misconceptions about Destiny security that are worth discussing here as well:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* \u201cDestiny does not have an anti-cheat\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Destiny does have anti-cheat that consists of custom security code and a third-party security product used by many other AAA games. We have a team of senior security engineers working on anti-cheat.\n&gt;   * Anti-cheat isn\u2019t a yes-or-no thing, it\u2019s a constellation of possible mitigations. We\u2019re always looking to add new stars to our constellation, and to strengthen existing ones.\n&gt;* \u201cDestiny relies on player reports or humans to identify cheaters\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * The vast majority of punishments issued come from automated detections. We use player reports to help us identify emerging threats. All automated detections are reviewed and verified by a human before punishment to minimize the risk of false positives.\n&gt;* \u2022\u201cDestiny should use Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC)\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Destiny does utilize some of VAC\u2019s security features, and we have plans to utilize more. Bungie\u2019s security team and Valve\u2019s security team meet regularly to discuss the latest attacks and mitigations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re also re-evaluating some of our decisions along the way \u2013 for example, we may have made a mistake in not having Trials behind the Season Pass paywall, which would have created more friction against free-account-recycling cheaters. We won\u2019t change this for Season of the Worthy, but we\u2019ll re-evaluate access requirements in future Seasons. At its best, Trials is a fountain of nail-biting space combat crescendos, and it\u2019s something you can\u2019t find anywhere else. We want that experience to be available to as many people as possible. But if we\u2019re forced to choose, we will choose for Trials to be a sacred space, even if that means fewer people can play.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Our overall goal with Destiny security is to provide a competitive, fair ecosystem where cheaters are rarely seen and are rapidly ejected from the game. We\u2019re not there right now, and we\u2019re increasing the priority. We\u2019ll keep you posted.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Guardian\u2019s Heart\n\nLast week, we unveiled the [Guardian\u2019s Heart charity initiative](https://tiltify.com/+bungie-community/guardians-heart/donate).

Here are this week's winners.\u00a0\n\n\n**Movie of the Week**: Crayola Crew\u00a0\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/SUb_B8d4qJE)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention**: Dance Dance Evolution\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvHQarHis4)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nAs Justin mentioned at the top of the TWAB, we covered the first two topics in a series of write-ups about some of the biggest current challenges with Destiny. We plan to unpack new topics each week and give regular updates on how our efforts are going[.](https://imgur.com/xAxYDrR)\n\n\nNext week, we plan on talking about our Seasonal model and bounties. We know there\u2019s been a lot of feedback on bounties, especially since Guardian Games utilizes them for scoring. We\u2019ll share some of the ways we\u2019ll be changing up bounties and how they\u2019re implemented in the future.\n\n\nBear with us as we work to steadily improve the game. Much like you, we love Destiny and we want it to be the best that it can be.\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame",

rivalry.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAnnounced earlier this morning, Guardian Games is fast on approach. Beginning April 21 at 10 AM PDT, the games begin. Titans, Hunters, and Warlocks will compete to prove which class is the most dedicated in Destiny 2.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/45u1Xv58zkM)\n\n\nYour entry into the competition begins with a visit to Eva Levante. Each Guardian will receive a class item to adorn while taking part in competition. Bronze, silver, and gold medals will be available to earn daily, each of which will focus on specific game modes. To earn medals, equip your new class item, defeat enemies, pick up laurels on the battlefield, and advance your quest for the medals you desire.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135037/Podium.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/atHNvJX.jpg)\n\n\nWe fully acknowledge that class populations are a little lopsided. Hunters are so fabulous with their capes that there are indeed more of them than Warlocks or Titans. To help offset this (so Hunters don\u2019t steal the show every day), medals will be weighted slightly per class to maintain an even playing field. We aren\u2019t fiddling with the numbers to force wins on alternate classes \u2013 Hunters could still take this entire thing if they put enough effort in.\n\n\nNow, about those class items. At daily reset, your Cloak, Mark, or Bond will update to reflect what placement your team has taken. As an example, if Titans took the \u201cW\u201d for day one, their Mark will update with a wonderful gold sigil. With Warlocks in second and Hunters in third, their class items would be updated to feature silver and bronze, respectively.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135037/GG_Hunter_Class.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ClSDayX.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135037/GG_Titan_Class.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Kuan14k.jpg)\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135037/GG_Warlock_Class.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1Kqg9J1.jpg)\n\n\nSo, what\u2019s the ultimate prize? At the end of the event, your daily placements will be combined for a final score. Depending on your team\u2019s standings, your class items will be locked to their respective placements for the remainder of the year.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more ways to represent your class, Eva has you covered. Each week, you\u2019ll be offered a free quest to earn an Exotic Ghost Shell, one themed to each Guardian class. Complete this quest every week to collect all three!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135037/GG_Ghosts.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MpWFopS.jpg)\n\n\nAdditionally, a new Exotic Machine Gun will become available during this event. We look forward to seeing what mayhem this tool of destruction will inspire when you get it in your hands.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135037/GG_Weapon.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Bj1am1B.jpg)\n\n\nEververse will also have some items in store for the event. A single Finisher will be available for Silver only, while all other items may be purchased with Bright Dust as they appear on the storefront. As a note, all Guardian Games weekly/repeatable bounties will grant Bright Dust to match previous Seasonal events.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/135/135037/GG_Armor.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/no5UcQM.jpg)\n\n\nGuardian Games begins upon the weekly reset \u2013 this Tuesday at 10 AM PDT. Make sure to launch your game a little early to grab the required Update 2.8.1. More on that in the Player Support Report below!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Guardian\u2019s Heart Update\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134835/A_Guardians_Heart_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sZ0MnX0.jpg)\n\n\nAt the time of writing this article, the [Guardian\u2019s Heart Charity Initiative](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48946) has generated over $450,000 for relief efforts in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nFor those that may not be up to speed, for this fundraising effort we\u2019ve partnered with Direct Relief, who will work with a network of providers across the globe to deliver the supplies that healthcare workers need. This includes basic personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks, gowns, and face shields. The hospitals where they work will also receive food covers, prescription medication, portable oxygen concentrators, ventilators, and other intensive care unit equipment.\n\n\n[Any donation of $20 or more will earn you the exclusive Guardian\u2019s Heart emblem.](https://tiltify.com/+bungie-community/guardians-heart) As a quick note, these will be distributed by Bungie within a week of your donation. Keep an eye out, as the email may be filtered to promotional or even spam folders in your inbox.\n\n\nTo help raise awareness and share some of the community action, we\u2019re hosting a series of Bungie Bounties for as long as this fundraising initiative lasts. This isn\u2019t restricted to North American Guardians, mind you. This is a worldwide effort, so we\u2019ll naturally have some international bounties for you to chase. We\u2019re getting some final details together for the full calendar. Stay tuned to find out who you\u2019ll be chasing over the next week.\n\n\nWe\u2019re also partnering with Guardians around the world to host a variety of Destiny streams that feature raid challenges, dungeon runs, and more. If you\u2019d like to show your support and host a stream for this initiative, [get in touch with us](https://twitter.com/gibsonfilms/status/1249840631796469762?s=20).\n\n\nStay tuned to [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie) for announcements.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Problem Children\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KDQZIiO.gif)\n\n\nIt seems that Guardian Games kicked off a little early for some Exotic items in our game, in terms of competition. Telesto, Winter\u2019s Guile, and Wormgod Caress are eyeing the top spot for \u201cbiggest problem child\u201d in our sandbox. The Destiny Player Support team has an update on their standings.\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**LET THE GAMES BEGIN**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next week, Guardian Games kicks off with the release of Destiny 2 Update 2.8.1. Please see below for the rollout timeline.\n\n\n* 9 AM PDT (1600 UTC): Destiny 2 service maintenance begins.\n* 9:45 AM PDT (1645 UTC): Destiny 2 is taken offline on all platforms.\n* 10 AM PDT (1700 UTC): Destiny 2 Update 2.8.0 begins rolling out across all platforms and regions. Players will be able to log back into Destiny 2 at 10:01 AM PDT.\n* 10:01 AM PDT (1701 UTC): Destiny 2 is back online on all platforms; Guardian Games begins.\n* 11 AM PDT (1800 UTC): Destiny 2 service maintenance concludes.\n* For future release timelines when they are available, players should visit our [Destiny Server and Update Status help article](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/13125). For live updates as this maintenance occurs, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed at [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**BEETLE ERRORS**\n&gt;\n&gt;During the team\u2019s investigation into BEETLE errors, it was discovered that players who were in Towers with more than 13 people would get BEETLE errors at a higher rate. As a temporary workaround, we have changed the number of players who can be in the Tower from 26 to 12 until a more permanent fix can be deployed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**UPCOMING RESOLVED ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;Below is a list of issues that will be resolved when Guardian Games and Update 2.8.1 becomes available on April 21:\n\n\n* Ward of Dawn will now correctly generate Orbs of Light.\n\n\n* Fully upgrading any bunker will now unlock the associated Warmind Security Triumph.\n* Interacting with the statue of Sjur Eido for the Wish Ender quest in the Shattered Throne will no longer crash the game.\n* The Level 32 PDS upgrade can now be used to clear the bunker by any character.\n* Rasputin\u2019s Daily Seraph Weapon can now be claimed on any character.\n* Players who've completed the Forsaken campaign will find The Lawless Frontier lore book entry \"By Thy Tongue Be Damned\" completed and available to claim.\n* Friends listed in a player's Roster should no longer show up as black nameplates with zero Power.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n\n\n* The Winter\u2019s Guile and Wormgod Caress Exotic gauntlets are retaining increased melee damage after their intended timer cooldowns. They have been disabled until a fix can be deployed at a later date.\n* The engram from the Trials Flawless chest will disappear for players who have earned all available Trials rewards.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Straight to Home Video\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/I24GjgZ.gif)\n\n\nWith more time at home, we\u2019re finding ourselves able to watch a few more movies. Our daily binges of Netflix can only carry us so far, but thankfully we have some awesome Destiny content to watch on the [Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations).\n\n\n**Movie of the Week:\u00a0 Fourth Horseman Rides Again**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDhDgxbm4c4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: 200 IQ Tether**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/K934QpzlWe0)\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a winner, make sure that your Bungie.net profile (and any profile of someone that contributed) is included in the description of your video. Without that key piece of information, we\u2019re unable to slap that rightfully deserved emblem on your collections tab.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nSo, we come to a close on another TWAB but we understand that there are some topics that weren\u2019t covered on here that you may have strong desire to know more about. Eververse, Trials improvements, our plans to address FOMO, tackling the bounty problem, and more. There are also questions like \u201cWhat about feeling like players can\u2019t play their way? What about Ritual weapons, anti-cheat improvements, etc?\u201d .\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been having frequent syncs to talk through these issues and more. Many of them require a long-term plan with short-term mitigation to help ease the pain. The last thing we want to do is over-commit to changes that ultimately may be reversed, or sign the team up for work that leads to crunch. We don\u2019t want to make promises we know we can\u2019t keep, so to speak.\n\n\nOver the next few weeks, we hope to solidify some plans and get them communicated out. We\u2019re looking at what can be accomplished in Season 11, which is coming much faster than many of us can believe. Some topics will be tackled in Season 12, as they\u2019ll require larger scale systematic changes.\n\n\nThank you again to everyone that\u2019s been giving feedback on Destiny over the years. This train never stops, and we hope to share our next steps with you soon. Until next time, we\u2019ll see you out there in the wild.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id":

opened.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nA third and final Seraph Bunker has opened on Io. The new Bunker points players to partake in the Seraph Tower event and new Legendary Lost Sectors on the Jovian moon. Guardians also made a new discovery in the bunker about Rasputin\u2019s efforts to track our enemies.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019re one month into Season of the Worthy and we\u2019re not done yet. Grandmaster Ordeal is only a few weeks away, but before we share more on that, let\u2019s talk about a new charity initiative coming up next week.\n\n\n***\n\n\n##Making a Difference\n\nAs the world responds to the outbreak of COVID-19, many of us have been urged by our local governments to stay home. Containing the spread of the virus is one of the best things we can do to protect our fellow humans. If you\u2019re a gamer, you\u2019ve been training for this moment for your whole life. If you possess the heart of a Guardian, however, you might be wrestling with the urge to do more!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis is the question we\u2019ve been asking ourselves at Bungie:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Is there something more we can do to help the real-world heroes who are confronting this crisis head on?\u00a0**\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve arrived at an answer that we think is very exciting. We\u2019d like to share it with you \u2013 and even welcome you to join us in helping to make the world a better place. On Monday, you\u2019re invited to join us in our game rooms to talk about it.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Bungie\u2019s COVID-19 Fundraiser\u00a0**\n\n**[www.twitch.tv/bungie\u00a0](http://www.twitch.tv/bungie )**\n\n**Monday, April 13\u00a0**\n\n**10:00 AM Pacific\u00a0**\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPlayers of Bungie games have never backed down from a fight. We\u2019ve banded together to support the survivors of floods, earthquakes, and wildfires. You may even have a memento to commemorate the role you played in some of those initiatives. On this occasion, when it seems like the world needs help more than ever, we have an emblem to mark the Guardians in our community who choose to throw their lot in with our efforts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134835/A_Guardians_Heart_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ObdEXTy.jpg)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn Monday, we\u2019ll reveal how you can earn this emblem to display proudly in game. We\u2019ll talk about this charitable call to action, who will benefit, and the impact that we will have together.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJoin us for the conversation. Join us to make a difference.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n##Grandmaster\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134835/Nightfall_The-Ordeal_Banner.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xOStk23.jpg)\n\n\nIn a few weeks, we\u2019ll debut a new difficulty selection for The Ordeal called Grandmaster. It will test your fireteam\u2019s coordination, communication, builds, and skill like no other activity in Destiny to date.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a look at a few of the goals we had when approaching Grandmaster after we saw how the rest of The Ordeal was received:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Grandmaster should build on Master difficulty, but be significantly more challenging.\u00a0\n* Once you reach a certain bar, the challenge should be found completely in perfecting your builds, communication, and execution.\u00a0\n* The primary rewards should be doled out on initial completion.\u00a0\n* Completion should be the primary metric for success, rather than score or time or another in-activity metric like \u2018killing all Champions\u2019\u00a0\n* Grandmaster should stress the top end of build crafting.\u00a0\n* Grandmaster should be watchable.\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u00a0\n\nTo attempt Grandmaster, you will need to be Power Level 1025 which is 15 Power above the Pinnacle cap but will be 25 Power below the activity which will be set at a Power Level of 1050. We\u2019re also going to have something similar to the Contest mode we introduced for Crown of Sorrow. You will gain no extra advantage for being higher than 1025. We wanted to require a mixture of pinnacle rewards and artifact power to get you prepared for this, but not make you feel like you had to put in a ton of extra hours over-leveling the activity.\n\n\nWe\u2019re introducing some new modifiers along with some familiar ones, including **Extinguish** (if your team wipes, it sends you back to orbit) and **Limited Revives** (you start with a small pool of shared team revives and you get more every time you kill a Champion). We don\u2019t want to spoil everything, so there are a few other wrinkles we\u2019ll let you discover when it goes live.\n\n\u202f\u00a0\n\nDoes this sound like a worthy challenge so far? We hope it does, and as a reward, you\u2019ll have increased chances of being awarded Exotic armor and Masterworking materials. But the main draw of the mode is the new Seal and title available for beating each of the Grandmaster Ordeal Strikes once during the Season: Conqueror. We want this to be one the most challenging titles to get, but we want it to be approachable for anyone to try who puts in the time and dedication with their team during a given Season.\u00a0\n\n\nGrandmaster Ordeal will begin on April 21.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Iron King\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134835/Iron_Banner_Armor_v480.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kR2dnuf.jpg)\n\n\nThe second coming of Iron Banner for this Season is already upon us. Lord Saladin will be setting up shop at the top of the Tower and you\u2019ll have another shot at finishing the quest and earning the new Bow.\u00a0\n\n\nBonus Valor gains are also enabled throughout the week.\n\n\n**Iron Banner and bonus valor begins at 10 AM PDT on April 14, running through 10 AM on April 21.\u00a0**\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Weekly Challenge Accepted\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/l9uUP1k.gif)\n\n\nPleas welcome in the Player Support team with the latest on known issues we\u2019re tracking.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###TRIALS WEEKLY CHALLENGE UPDATE\n&gt;\n&gt;Last week, we released [Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.8.0.2](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48879). As part of the hotfix, we resolved an issue where Trials of Osiris Weekly Challenges were not being reset properly. We believed the issue would be resolved later that week when Trials of Osiris went live, but [the issue persisted](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1246158586767532032), causing players who didn\u2019t have their Weekly Challenge to not receive any rewards on their third, fifth, or seventh win.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Starting this Friday, April 10, all players are expected to have their Weekly Challenge available to them when Trials of Osiris becomes active.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###CLAN CREATION AND EDITING\n&gt;\n&gt;Players may notice that they are unable to create or edit their clans in Destiny 2. [While we investigate this issue](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1245146920533626880), players can still join or leave Destiny 2 clans at any time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###PC CRASHING UPDATE\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday, we worked with Valve to issue a small update to Destiny 2 on Steam that should resolve a crashing issue players have been receiving. This small update is also helping us to determine what is causing the BEAVER error code to appear more frequently.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###BEAVER ERROR CODES\n&gt;\n&gt;Since Season of the Worthy began, we have been seeing a significant increase in the following error codes: ANTEATER, BEAVER, BEETLE, and WATERCRESS. While we continue to investigate the cause of these error codes, we have implemented fixes that have helped reduce the number of BEAVER errors on Steam, which you can see illustrated in the chart below.\u00a0We understand how frustrating and painful it can be to receive this or any error code, and we\u2019re working intensely on further mitigations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134835/Graph.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jIsnS3Z.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Fully upgrading any Seraph Bunker sometimes doesn't unlock the associated **Warmind Security Triumph**. This issue is expected to be resolved in our next update.\n&gt;\n&gt;Warden of Nothing doesn't give **platinum rewards** if one of the Unstoppable Champions is killed by a train.\n&gt;\n&gt;The **Dynamic Charge perk** doesn\u2019t activate on Symmetry if shot through Citan's Ramparts assisted Assault Barricade.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Showtime\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tFS4NHa.gif)\n\n\nLet['](https://i.imgur.com/dYoGVtf.jpg)s move on to some movies shall we? This is our weekly ritual of picking some of our favorite community-created videos and showcasing them here for all to see. All winners will receive a cool emblem as proof that their film was featured. Here we go.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week**:\u00a0 I Collect Motes Not Deposit Them\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naP7gy0K5LE)\n\n\nHonorable Mention: Don\u2019t Tell Zavalla\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nYpOoXbbw)\n\n\nIf you do end up winning, please make sure you put a link to your bungie.net profile page so we can send you the emblem.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIn case you missed it, we had a [great conversation](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48916) with the voice actor for Ana Bray earlier this week. Go check it out!\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019re looking forward to the charity stream next week. It\u2019s always a pleasure seeing our community show off the amazing things you can do when given the opportunity to support a great cause. Guardians truly share some of the heroic qualities of their in-game counterparts.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo\u00a0**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1416764, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 4/09/2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fy0z6p/this_week_at_bungie_4092020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "collections": [{"author_id": "t2_mocx5", "author_name": "DTG_Bot", "collection_id": "3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "created_at_utc": 1565530291.728, "description": "A list of all This Week At Bungie posts.", "display_layout": null, "last_update_utc": 1585866308.253, "link_ids": ["t3_af25cd", "t3_ah481q", "t3_ajsedl", "t3_alvfka", "t3_ao9wte", "t3_aqpxzn", "t3_at9ul5", "t3_avx91v", "t3_ayk8tz", "t3_b15gjp", "t3_b3wyr2", "t3_b6obl3", "t3_b9k4wk", "t3_bc5jkp", "t3_besokf", "t3_bhe8w9", "t3_bk1cnt", "t3_bmpymm", "t3_bpj5x6", "t3_bs9s8g", "t3_buzcp4", "t3_bxmngp", "t3_c0c9sb", "t3_c311of", "t3_c6bun6", "t3_cc0flf", "t3_cez1le", "t3_chufi1", "t3_ckuatg", "t3_cnreiv", "t3_cqwvcm", "t3_cu4h82", "t3_cx5ul9", "t3_d07vph", "t3_d3eovr", "t3_d6l8js", "t3_d9rjjg", "t3_dcy6rk", "t3_dg5pwn", "t3_djdrul", "t3_dmnqin", "t3_dptooj", "t3_dt5x25", "t3_dwhjnh", "t3_dzqtrz", "t3_e21qrm", "t3_e6oqhs", "t3_e9u6k8", "t3_ed20nj", "t3_emho4d", "t3_eprd61", "t3_et16vp", "t3_ewe159", "t3_f00num", "t3_f3iarh", "t3_f73765", "t3_famkx4", "t3_fe3vsc", "t3_fhp0em", "t3_flitev", "t3_fpknrx", "t3_ftvz1z"], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/collection/3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "title": "This Week At Bungie"}], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1585866308, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ftvz1z/this_week_at_bungie_422020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ftvz1z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 540, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ftvz1z/this_week_at_bungie_422020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "f1A1j9qE03dtarMLecQRoeD3R3YTe3eIPK5iFFI70_U", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gvbr9XAyUY7_JEW_wki6t44k7Fau683RqVpHNtyYwNg.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c63cbc61914512b854b995aa1d0f0218a036176", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gvbr9XAyUY7_JEW_wki6t44k7Fau683RqVpHNtyYwNg.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03f5fb823e277d54cd66210cc246e5a25807b06f", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gvbr9XAyUY7_JEW_wki6t44k7Fau683RqVpHNtyYwNg.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0d1acc8728e97d5803813458b1b4e11b0935340", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gvbr9XAyUY7_JEW_wki6t44k7Fau683RqVpHNtyYwNg.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07e54b33ebe9ac933492b09a20dbb7150962affd", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gvbr9XAyUY7_JEW_wki6t44k7Fau683RqVpHNtyYwNg.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=620b91cf318ed3e23b950c50483f25e39cd84566", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gvbr9XAyUY7_JEW_wki6t44k7Fau683RqVpHNtyYwNg.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e5ef702fef9d6b97361ab3ab93502088319875", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1080, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/gvbr9XAyUY7_JEW_wki6t44k7Fau683RqVpHNtyYwNg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5f29a6e1541e88638ae5f9825cdb1746020d50e5", "width": 1920}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1585866314, "score": 1, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48919\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we look towards Io.\n\n\nSo, you\u2019re a few weeks into your seasonal journey. You\u2019ve cleared the EDZ Bunker of Fallen, and have been taking the Hive to task on the Moon. You\u2019ve reclaimed The Fourth Horseman, and maybe even completed its catalyst. So, what\u2019s next?\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134742/Destiny_SoW_Calendar_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nqiiJah.jpg)\n\n\nTuesday, the final Seraph bunker will open on Io. New Seraph weapons and seasonal mods enter the mix, giving you more options to build your monster-killing machine. Later in the month, Guardian Games will kick off some good old-fashioned Guardian rivalry, accompanied by the Grandmaster Nightfall difficulty.\u00a0\n\n\nThis week, we\u2019ll be parsing through some feedback we\u2019ve been seeing since the season launched, and discussing next steps for emblem stat trackers.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Focused Feedback\n\nOver the last few weeks, we\u2019ve been watching the conversation about Season of the Worthy, and more specifically Trials of Osiris. We wanted to walk through the topics we\u2019ve been exploring and give some basic thoughts on what we\u2019d like to approach in the future. Some items below may be addressed in the coming weeks, but other may take a season or more to tackle. We\u2019re having meetings and discussions daily to determine the best course of action. In the meantime, it\u2019s important to us that you know your voices are heard.\n\n\n***Card Rewards***\n\nWe\u2019ve been discussing feedback around a lack of incentive for players to go Flawless. We understand that some players have found the first few games to be more lucrative, which we\u2019d love to shift to the later games. Early card token farming, as some would call it, is something that we are very interested in solving. We want to make sure that every Destiny player who wants to play Trials has something to show for it at the end of a weekend.\n\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve seen feedback that the Flawless chest isn\u2019t comparable the rewards associated with grinding out Nightfalls. This is something that we\u2019d love to improve upon. There are quite a few ways we could approach this, and we\u2019re currently discussing what would be the best for Trials in the long run.\n\n\n***Disconnections***\n\nWe\u2019ve been investigating an issue that prevented us from enabling rejoin options when Trials first launched. The short version: A player\u2019s score could reset if that player left and rejoins the match. Since we\u2019ve resolved this issue, we are currently planning to enable rejoin in Update 2.8.1.\n\n\nAdditionally, our teams are continuing to investigate the rise in error codes since the launch of the season. This is one of our top priorities, and we\u2019ve made some progress in identifying the issue. What\u2019s left is developing a fix and testing it. We want to take the appropriate time here to avoid introducing any further issues into the game.\n\n\n***Fair Play***\n\nWe\u2019ve seen reports from players that have encountered cheaters in Trials over the last few weekends. What follows is a quick update on what we\u2019ve been doing to improve your experience, and what we\u2019re discussing internally for future improvements. To restate the note in the intro, some of these items may not be addressed for some time, as we\u2019re in early conversations, but we wanted to give you an update of what\u2019s going on behind the scenes here at Bungie.\u00a0\n\n\n* Our anti-cheat is not as \u201cvisible\u201d (by design) as some security products. However, we regularly detect and remove thousands of malicious accounts from the PvP ecosystem.\n* On the front lines we continue to implement new anti-cheat improvements during patch releases (we don\u2019t include these in the patch notes for obvious reasons), and are always investigating new approaches as cheat developers adapt to our latest tech.\n* Many of the cheats you may find in the wild already have detections and countermeasures deployed or in development, with work being done constantly to keep them updated against new threats. Because cheat developers don\u2019t stop, we know we have to keep working to improve these systems.\n\n   * Note: This is a tricky line to walk, as we don\u2019t want to punish any innocent players that may consistently have high stats due to extreme skill, game bugs, or game logic exploits which Bungie considers our fault.\n* We are working with our platform partners to identify ways in which we can further strengthen our security.\n* We are investigating ways in which we can let you know when your reports have resulted in a permanent ban or a temporary restriction.\n\n\nAdditionally, we wanted to give a few tips on information that helps us during our investigations when processing reports from the \u201c[Report Suspected Cheating](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13967)\u201d contact form. Important Note: Do NOT post any of this information publicly. Not on Reddit. Not on the Bungie forums. This information should only go in this specific form. Here\u2019s the information we are looking for:\n\n\n\n* Display name of the \u201cknown good\u201d player. Is this you? A friend of yours?\n* Display name of the suspect(s) and any other identifying info you have (clan name, Steam ID, etc.)\n* Explain what suspicious behavior was observed.\n* Note the platform the behavior was observed on.\n* Provide a link to the Post-Game Carnage Report (PGCR) on Bungie.net.\n\n\nAnd if possible:\n\n\n\n* Give us links to any video evidence. This could be a YouTube video or archived Twitch stream with timestamps, a clip, or a video you have recorded and shared via a public sharing service. (Sorry, we can\u2019t connect to your private Google Drive or OneDrive to view a video).\n\n\nI know that some of you out there may find the statement of \u201cWe\u2019re listening!\u201d to be a repetitive clich\u00e9 of community management, but the first step toward taking action is to listen. We\u2019ve been collecting your feedback and looking to fully understand the root of the perceived issues that are being discussed by players in the wild. Your voice is important to us, and helps us as we walk the path to what\u2019s next in Destiny 2. We\u2019ll be sure to keep you updated on our plans as they become more concrete, and we thank you for your continued feedback on the game.\n\n\nSpeaking of the future, let\u2019s talk about Stat Trackers.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Back on Track\n\nAt the beginning of the season, changes were introduced to stat trackers to give players more ways to express their achievements in Destiny 2. We introduced weekly Seasonal and Lifetime trackers, and these were completely optional to those who might want to have a clean emblem. With this overhaul, previously featured trackers were removed. Players were quick to highlight this as a pain point, which we\u2019re eager to address. This week, we have a list of the stats we\u2019ll be bringing back in Update 2.8.1, which is coming later this month.\n\n\n* Seasons\n\n\n   * Career\n\n\n      * Forge Completions\n      * All of the Trackers below are hidden if their value is zero:\n\n\n         * Season 8 Season Pass Rank Earned\n         * Season 9 Season Pass Rank Earned\n         * Number of Tier III encounters completed in the Reckoning\n\n\n         * Fractaline Donated\n         * Menagerie Completions\n         * Heroic Menagerie Completions\n         * Kills of Haunted Forest Terrors\n         * Deepest Branch of Haunted Forest Cleared\n         * Completed Branches of the Verdant Forest\n         * Revelric Light triggers during the Revelry\n         * Candy Collected\n         * Recipes Baked\n* Account\n\n\n   * Career\n\n\n      * Heroic Missions Completed\n      * All of the Trackers below are visible on their class:\n\n\n         * Kills as a Sentinel Titan\n         * Kills as a Striker Titan\n         * Kills as a Sunbreaker Titan\n         * Kills as a Arcstrider Hunter\n         * Kills as a Nightstalker Hunter\n         * Kills as a Gunslinger Hunter\n         * Kills as a Stormcaller Warlock\n         * Kills as a Dawnblade Warlock\n         * Kills as a Voidwalker Warlock\n* Crucible\n\n\n   * Career\n\n\n      * Gold Medals Earned\n      * Longest Glory Win Streak\n      * Total Valor Resets\n      * Iron Banner Rank\n      * Gold Medals Earned in Iron Banner\n      * Iron Banner Bounties Completed\n      * All of the Trackers below are hidden if their value is zero:\n\n\n         * Wins in Trials of the Nine\n         * Flawless tickets in Trials of Nine\n         * 7th column Medals Earned\n         * Annihilation Medals Earned\n         * Undefeated Medals Earned\n         * We Ran Out of Medals Medals Earned\n         * Ghost in the Night Medals Earned\n         * This Crown is Mine Medals Earned\n         * I Made This for You Medals Earned\n         * Kills in Crimson Doubles\n         * Kills while under the effects of Iron Burden\n* Destination\n\n\n   * Career\n\n\n      * Kills of Final Bosses in Escalation Protocol\n      * Available on Mars and Escalation Protocol Emblems\n      * All of the Trackers below are available on Luna Emblems:\n\n\n         * Completed Nightmare Hunts on Master Difficulty\n         * Pit of Heresy Solo Flawless Completions\n* Gambit\n\n\n   * Career\n\n\n      * Infamy Rank Resets\n* Raids\n\n\n   * Career\n\n\n      * Prestige Leviathan Completions\n      * Available on Leviathan and Guided Games Emblems\n      * Prestige Eater of Worlds Completions\n      * Available on Eater of Worlds and Guided Games Emblems\n      * Prestige Spire of Stars Completions\n      * Available on Spire of Stars and Guided Games Emblems\n* Strikes\n\n\n   * Career\n\n\n      * Nightfall Challenge Completions\n\n\nWe understand that there may be a few stats that are still not present that you\u2019re interested in returning. To be clear, we have a hard cap on how many stats can be listed on emblems, so we want to make sure we have room to grow in the future. Please continue to give feedback on what you\u2019d like to see, and we\u2019ll keep you in the know of what our plans are.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Under the Magnifying Glass\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130022/D2_DPS_Gif_Lowres_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/E5Mhils.gif)\n\nNo stone is left unturned when Destiny Player Support is on the case. When issues begin to trend, they disperse troubleshooting articles, but also dig deep to diagnose the issues.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**HOTFIX 2.8.0.2**\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday, March 31, we released Hotfix 2.8.0.2 to the world. While maintenance was underway, we incorrectly noted two items in the 2.8.0.2 patch notes:\n\n\n* A fix where bunker upgrades on the Season Pass are only unlocked on one character.\u00a0\n* A fix where the first weekly clear of a Legendary Lost Sector won't award a powerful drop.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;These issues were not fixed in 2.8.0.2. Fixes for these issues will be available with a later update.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here\u2019s a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n\n\n* We are continuing to investigate increased WATERCRESS and NEWT errors.\n* We have identified an issue with the Felwinter\u2019s Helm exotic helmet that allows players to emit a detonation impulse that blinds and weakens enemies on any kill. We have disabled this Exotic until a fix can be deployed at a later date.\n* We are investigating reports of players who have their emblems blacked out completely with power appearing as 0 in the Roster tab of the Director.\n* The Level 32 PDS upgrade can only be used to clear the Bunker by the character who unlocked the EDZ Bunker.\u00a0\n* Rasputin\u2019s Daily Seraph Weapon can only be claimed on the character players were on when Rank 92 of the Season Pass was unlocked \u2013 this cannot be claimed on other characters.\n* The Cloak of the Exile Trials armor is not glowing properly when going Flawless in Trials of Osiris.\n* Defeating an enemy with the ranged Celestial Fire Warlock melee ability does not trigger the Warlord's Sigil perk on the Winter's Guile Exotic gauntlets.\n* The lore piece \"By Thy Tongue Be Damned\" is not properly unlocking for players.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Spinning Up\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sEfwMZH.gif)\n\n\nLook, I\u2019m biased towards Omolon weapons. Hard Light was one of my first Exotics back when Destiny first launched, and it\u2019s fun to see it take the spotlight for a season. That said, Auto Rifles in general are pretty hot right now. This week\u2019s winner takes Suros for a spin, making some great plays in the Crucible.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: The Suros Simulation**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD7azowMCUw&amp;amp;feature=emb_title)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Honey, I\u2019m good\u2026**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS8GKFb1p9c&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like a chance at a fancy new emblem, cook up a creation and [post it over on Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThe days and weeks are beginning to meld together. As our local weather station put it, we\u2019ve entered the month of \u201cMaprilay.\u201d The sun continues to rise and fall, but it\u2019s becoming a little difficult to keep track of what day it is. Thankfully, we have Destiny 2 to bring us together during these times of isolation. Sometimes, the only thing I have to remind me of what day of the week we are living is this every-Thursday mainstay blog article.\u00a0\n\n\nI\u2019d like to take a moment to highlight the Essential Workers of the world. While we\u2019re all in this together, we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You are all Legends in our eyes. You\u2019re helping to keep the world spinning in times of crisis, and we cannot thank you enough for your efforts.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019re cooking up some initiatives on our side to amplify the good in this world. More on that soon\u2026\n\n\nMuch love,\n\nDmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1400790, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 4/2/2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ftvz1z/this_week_at_bungie_422020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "collections": [{"author_id": "t2_mocx5", "author_name": "DTG_Bot", "collection_id": "3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "created_at_utc": 1565530291.728, "description": "A list of all This Week At Bungie posts.", "display_layout": null, "last_update_utc": 1585260081.771, "link_ids": ["t3_af25cd", "t3_ah481q", "t3_ajsedl", "t3_alvfka", "t3_ao9wte", "t3_aqpxzn", "t3_at9ul5", "t3_avx91v", "t3_ayk8tz", "t3_b15gjp", "t3_b3wyr2", "t3_b6obl3", "t3_b9k4wk", "t3_bc5jkp", "t3_besokf", "t3_bhe8w9", "t3_bk1cnt", "t3_bmpymm", "t3_bpj5x6", "t3_bs9s8g", "t3_buzcp4", "t3_bxmngp", "t3_c0c9sb", "t3_c311of", "t3_c6bun6", "t3_cc0flf", "t3_cez1le", "t3_chufi1", "t3_ckuatg", "t3_cnreiv", "t3_cqwvcm", "t3_cu4h82", "t3_cx5ul9", "t3_d07vph", "t3_d3eovr", "t3_d6l8js", "t3_d9rjjg", "t3_dcy6rk", "t3_dg5pwn", "t3_djdrul", "t3_dmnqin", "t3_dptooj", "t3_dt5x25", "t3_dwhjnh", "t3_dzqtrz", "t3_e21qrm", "t3_e6oqhs", "t3_e9u6k8", "t3_ed20nj", "t3_emho4d", "t3_eprd61", "t3_et16vp", "t3_ewe159", "t3_f00num", "t3_f3iarh", "t3_f73765", "t3_famkx4", "t3_fe3vsc", "t3_fhp0em", "t3_flitev", "t3_fpknrx"], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/collection/3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "title": "This Week At Bungie"}], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1585260081, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpknrx/this_week_at_bungie_3262020/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fpknrx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_css_class": "bungie", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Bungie"}], "link_flair_template_id": "2f13ba30-3d46-11e9-8cd7-0e03d8e4b5da", "link_flair_text": "Bungie", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 668, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpknrx/this_week_at_bungie_3262020/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "_wA61L1S8vdSawgJ-cvguDGrRrUc2on7eOgQnC2l-wo", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dda6hxmyUKwAGyICOydyPfM2KPM4cFkaVSlYO06p9dw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59f276719df8593f331c02356323fb9121120140", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dda6hxmyUKwAGyICOydyPfM2KPM4cFkaVSlYO06p9dw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b367d9c3147988f8e831463dc0879852561a59c8", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dda6hxmyUKwAGyICOydyPfM2KPM4cFkaVSlYO06p9dw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a297c5068c4763d7666a6d51833f0b273b9ce0aa", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dda6hxmyUKwAGyICOydyPfM2KPM4cFkaVSlYO06p9dw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e98e8a7af9b0f9ffcd58adb454a63edfab9fd453", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dda6hxmyUKwAGyICOydyPfM2KPM4cFkaVSlYO06p9dw.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb07ece056237003b3b539309370d0625a2266f3", "width": 960}, {"height": 607, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dda6hxmyUKwAGyICOydyPfM2KPM4cFkaVSlYO06p9dw.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92a1a5f3f212ca8bc82350b6773feb7fe4c2c096", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1080, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Dda6hxmyUKwAGyICOydyPfM2KPM4cFkaVSlYO06p9dw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=c5dd22490659b5e4f6ad07fdbf4975b4eaac76ba", "width": 1920}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1585260313, "score": 8, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48878\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, a new bunker was discovered.\u00a0\n\n\nDoors, once hidden, open on the lunar surface revealing another Seraph Bunker in Rasputin\u2019s network. Guardians have begun exploring it to see what upgrades lie within. And if you\u2019re up for the challenge, there are also new Legendary Lost Sectors available and new weapons to get your hands on.\n\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Lord Saladin is at the Tower and has a new Bow for you to earn along with several opportunities for pinnacle drops. On top of all that, week three of Trials of Osiris begins tomorrow. What map do you think will be featured this week?\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##World Drops\n\nThere were several armor sets added to the engram loot pool with Season of the Worthy. We saw a lot of feedback that, while you were excited to see your favorite armor sets from the past, the fact that none of them had Seasonal mod slots made them feel less desirable and not worth including in your builds.\n\n\nGood news! We\u2019re adding Seasonal mod slots to these sets in an update next month. The three faction sets will get Season of the Worthy mod slots and the rest of the armor will get either Season of Dawn or Season of the Undying mod slots.\n\n\n**Season of Dawn Mod Slot Added:**\n\n\n\n* Dead End Cure\n* Retro-Grade TG2\n* Heiro Camo\n* Road Complex AA1\n* Devastation Complex\n* High-Minded Complex\n\n\n**Season of the Undying Mod Slot Added:**\n\n\n\n* Red Moon Phantom\n* Mimetic Savior\n* Thorium Holt\n* Tangled Web\n* Prodigal\n* Frumious\n* Noble Constant Type 2\n* Ego Talon IV\n* Errant Knight\n* Kerak Type 2\n* Philomath\n\n\nAll of these sets will be able to use Seasonal mods from the Seasons before and after the Season they are designated above (as explained in a [previous TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/48727)).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##The Fixings \n\nWe are currently targeting Tuesday, March 31 to deploy Hotfix 2.8.0.2. The main target of this update will be the issue affecting Trials of Osiris challenges not being reset properly. Here\u2019s a quick preview of other fixes coming in this update:\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where upgrades on the Season Pass where only unlocked for one character and will now properly unlock for the entire account.\n* Fixed an issue where the first weekly clear of a Legendary Lost Sector would not award a powerful drop.\n* Fixed an issue with Raiju\u2019s Harness that allowed players to hold Whirlwind Guard indefinitely.\n* Fixed an issue where Titan Season Pass arms ornament would block first person view.\n* Season Pass SMG and Shotgun will now create Warmind cells with Season Pass ornaments equipped.\n* Fixed an issue where Sentinel Titans were able to extend Sentinel Shield/Banner Shield by suppressing themselves.\n* Fixed an issue where players were not getting the correct amount of planetary materials from bunker upgrades.\n\n\nAside from the fixes in 2.8.0.2 we\u2019re also continuing to investigate disconnects, crashes, and error codes being reported since 2.8.0 we released. Currently, we are seeing elevated disconnects from the Tower on all platforms but disconnects from other activities seems PC-specific.\n\n\nThe fix we deployed has appeared to resolve the crashes affecting Gambit, but didn\u2019t help with other disconnects. We have made additional attempts at fixing disconnects that haven\u2019t resulted in a decline in error codes and are continuing to work on new fixes for elevated Beaver, Beetle, Anteater, and Rabbit errors. We\u2019ll give you more information as soon as we can.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Twitch Prime Rewards \n\nWe continued our monthly rollout of Twitch Prime Rewards today. If you have an active Prime subscription, [visit this page](https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/destiny2) to link your Bungie.net account and claim your rewards. After that, they should be available at Amanda Holliday in the Tower. Here\u2019s a look at what you can get this month:\n\n\n\n* Prometheus Lens - Exotic Weapon\n* Eye of Osiris \u2013 Exotic Weapon Ornament\n* Tyrant Shell - Exotic Ghost Shell\n* Fleet Ska IX - Legendary Ship\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/134/134094/16_9_Twitch_Drop3.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/40eEcPV.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Player Support Report\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hJRJZFS.gif)\n\n\n\nDestiny Player Support is constantly tracking known issues in the wild.\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###TRIALS WEEKLY CHALLENGE RESET TIME\n&gt;\n&gt;Last weekend, Destiny Player Support noticed an increase in reports about players not receiving powerful rewards from their third, fifth, or seventh Trials of Osiris win. Upon investigation, the team discovered an error in the Weekly Challenge reset time.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Trials of Osiris Weekly Challenges will unlock at 5 PM PDT on Saturdays. At this time, rewards are expected to be reset for players who have been impacted, and rewards will be granted when players reach three, five, or seven wins respectively. In a future patch, we will move this reset to the Friday daily reset.\n&gt;\n&gt;###SEASON OF THE WORTHY SEAL\n&gt;\n&gt;We have noticed that players have been trying unsuccessfully to unlock a hidden Triumph in the Season of the Worthy Almighty Seal when meeting the requirements. This Triumph is not currently available to unlock but will be so in late April.\n&gt;\n&gt;###RASPUTIN BUNKER BOUNTIES\n&gt;\n&gt;With the Moon Bunker now unlocked, Destiny Player Support noticed some confusion about the bounties Rasputin offered.

again.\n\n\nSome of you may have heard the legend of the Fourth Horseman - a weapon so powerful, Spider Tanks run from it in fear. Any enemy foolish enough to come within range\u2026 ripped apart within seconds by the arc pellets launched from its four barrels. At the invitation of Zavala, you can get your hands on this beautiful Shotgun in Destiny 2.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y11Zr2Ra504)\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to strike fear into the hearts of the Cabal, but feel this already ridiculous weapon needs a little something extra. Keep your eyes peeled for its catalyst by continuing to upgrade Rasputin through Seraph public events, or clear Legendary Lost Sectors of the darkness found within.\n\n\nAnd so, we begin another TWAB. Your weekly dose of Bungie and Destiny 2 news. We\u2019ve got some exciting news on a new Twitch extension, an update from the Bungie Foundation, and more. While there isn\u2019t a cat picture hidden in this article, I still expect you to read every single word. No exceptions.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##An Extension of Your Hand\n\nWith weekend-two of Trials of Osiris on rapid approach, we\u2019re excited to announce our first Bungie-developed Twitch extension. Bridging the gap between streamer and viewer, you can now quickly glance at the current state of the streamer\u2019s Perks, passage, weapons, armor, perks, mods, catalysts, and more.\n\n\nWe\u2019re also launching the first Twitch Weekly Bounty. After each match, you\u2019ll have time to react to a clutch play (or heartbreaking loss) with some Destiny-themed emotes and earn progress towards this unique Bounty. Upon completion, players will be rewarded with Glimmer, XP, and Trials Tokens within Destiny 2.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133839/Destiny2_TwitchExt_TWAB.mp4)\n\n\nFor more information on the Destiny 2 Official Twitch Extension, please visit our [Twitch Extension Support](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48844) and our [Twitch Extension Error Code articles](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48852).\n\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at expanding the extension to apply to more activities in Destiny 2. Which activities would you like to be supported in the future? What other bounties would you like to see? Sound off!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Lightmakers // Lightbreakers\n\nWith the return of Trials of Osiris, players have a fresh opportunity to put some new accomplishments on display. You may have seen a few Guardians in the wild flaunting stat trackers with their flawless passage count or the number of Guardians they\u2019ve defeated.\n\n\nBy using specific emblems granted from the Flawless Chest, players can earn unique stats as they complete more passages within the activity. We also introduced a way for Guardians to identify themselves as Lightmakers or Lightbreakers.\n\n\n**Lightmakers:** With the \u201cLight for the Lost\u201d Emblem equipped, help Guardians to their first ever flawless passage. You can be identified by white glows on your Flawless armor.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133832/Carry-Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/10hRWK7.jpg)\n\n\n**Lightbreakers:** With the \u201cFlawless Empyrean\u201d Emblem equipped, reach seven wins on a passage, and then continue winning matches. You can be identified by red glows on your Flawless armor.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133832/Streak-Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/J93aNJb.jpg)\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen many of you taking on these roles in the wild already and are excited to see how high you climb in the stat charts. Please note: In order for the emblems to track their associated stats correctly, players must have the emblem equipped when completing their respective requirements. We\u2019ll be highlighting some of the greatest Lightmakers and Lightbreakers among you in future articles, so get to it!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Smelting Iron\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133832/Iron_Banner_Armor_v480.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wj4CPJg.jpg)\n\n\nOnce again, Lord Saladin calls upon Guardians to test the strength of their iron. While Power-enabled combat is no longer exclusive to Iron Banner, this is your 6v6 battleground. As announced earlier today, Artifact Power will be disabled in Iron Banner. Don\u2019t worry though, you\u2019ll still have the opportunity to put your pinnacle Power on display.\n\n\nThis Season, Saladin is also offering a pursuit weapon as reward for completing the \u201cSmelting Light\u201d quest. You\u2019ll be challenged to capture zones and defeat opponents with a collection of weapons on your journey to earning the \u201cPoint of the Stag.\u201d\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133832/irobnanner_bow.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cxqwMzm.jpg)\n\n\nThe Iron Remembrance armor sets also make their return, upped to Armor 2.0 standards. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to earn some innacle Power rewards by completing weekly bounties. Additionally, Iron Banner armor pieces have chances for higher stat rolls from bounties, vendor packages, and post-game drops.\n\n\nIron Banner begins at 10 AM PDT on March 24, running through 10 AM on March 31.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Bungie Foundation Update\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133832/Foundation_Banner.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mOTfeMv.png)\n\nOver the last few months, we\u2019ve had a few initiatives from the Bungie Foundation to help those in need. This week, we\u2019d like to share some insight on our efforts to help during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and provide an update on Guardians for Australia.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Foundation:** With so much going on around the world right now, we know it can be anxiety-provoking, confusing, and stressful. Because of that, it is more important than ever to lift each other up and put the well-being of others, especially those who are in need, before ourselves. It has been encouraging to see communities join together in solidarity to keep themselves and others safe and healthy.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As a company located in the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak here in Washington State, we believe it is important to help our local community through this crisis. Bungie is grateful to partner with the [Boys &amp; Girls Club of Bellevue (BGCB)](http://www.bgcbellevue.org/), which is doing life-saving work for our local families. While all local schools remain closed through the end of April, the BGCB is committed to keeping as many of their facilities open as possible to care for children, so that parents who must continue to go work are able to do so. In addition, they are feeding and providing necessary supplies for families in crisis.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Bungie is providing a $160,000 grant that will enable the BGCB to operate four sites across the Bellevue region through the end of April in order to care for our community\u2019s most vulnerable low-income and homeless families. This care will allow more families to continue earning income and paying their rent, while keeping their families fed and healthy, and will help to minimize long-term repercussions from this crisis.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While many of us live in areas that have been encouraged to practice social distancing, there are always ways to help your fellow neighbor. Here are a few things to consider:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Support your local small businesses. As an example, if your gym is closed, please consider retaining your membership so that they can afford to re-open their doors.\u00a0\n* Support family-owned restaurants by ordering take-out or. Search for local fundraisers like GoFundMe that are providing financial support to restaurant workers, artists, performers, and more that are without work during the shutdowns.\n* Support your nonprofits. Many major fundraising activities have been cancelled or postponed. If you plan to donate to any organization this year, please consider doing it now rather than later. Many organizations depend on those fundraisers and are in a really tight spot without those funds.\u00a0\n* Support families in your community. Make a donation to your local food bank, United Way, or Boys &amp; Girls Club. These organizations are able to leverage every dollar to deliver critical support to families in need.\n* Donate blood. Since the outbreak, there has been a drastic drop in blood donations nationwide (approximately 86,000 fewer than is normal in this time period), at a time when our hospitals are at or nearing capacity. If you are healthy and showing no signs of fever or other symptoms, please contact your local Red Cross or other local agencies to make a donation.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stay safe, stay positive, and love your neighbor. We\u2019re all in this together.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Bungie Foundation is also proud to announce its Guardians for Australia t-shirt campaign has raised $1 million USD (approximately 1.6 million AUD at the time of sending) to support those impacted by the Australian bushfires. Since launching on January 14, over 75,000 shirts were sold and are now on their way to supportive guardians worldwide.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We also want to take this opportunity to give a special thanks to our partners Sunrise Identity, PMC Fulfillment, Pacific Sportswear, and Brand Access for their support to maximize donations to the organizations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Guardians for Australia t-shirt incorporates iconic Australian flora and fauna, as well as a Guardian ship patrolling the landscape overhead. Funds raised will go towards the NSW Rural Fire Service and WIRES.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\"We are blown away by the outpouring of love and generosity the Bungie community has shown for Australia following their devastating wildfire seasons. Because of our fans, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service will be better equipped to deal with future challenges and serve the community in times of need. WIRES will be able to rehabilitate their sick, injured and displaced wildlife while restoring their natural habitats. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for continuing to demonstrate that the Bungie community is stronger together and truly makes our world a better and kinder place.\"\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;- Christine Edwards, Senior Bungie Foundation Manager\n\n\nThe Guardians for Australia fundraiser follows previous efforts for the 2015 earthquake relief in Nepal and the 2017 relief effort for Hurricane Harvey. Bungie also ran Game2Give in 2018 to support the Bungie Foundation\u2019s iPads for Kids Program and Children\u2019s Miracle Network benefiting sick kids across the United States.\n\n\nTo learn more about Bungie's fundraising efforts, you can visit the [Bungie Foundation's website](https://bungiefoundation.org/).\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Get that door open, Zavala\u2026\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130022/D2_DPS_Gif_Lowres_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YFGRscw.gif)\n\n\nDuring last week, Destiny Player Support has been attacking bugs from all angles. Crashes, Gambit error codes, and more. It wouldn\u2019t be a new Season without a few speedbumps, now would it?\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;**A FLAWLESS SEASON**\n&gt;\n&gt;Since the launch of Season of the Worthy, we have received questions regarding the Flawless title for Trials of Osiris. The Flawless title can be earned in Season of the Worthy as well as future seasons. All triumphs must be completed within a single season; if a player has completed some triumphs but not all by the end of Season of the Worthy, they must earn those triumphs again in the next season.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum:\n\n\n* Ornaments for Dunemarchers, Raiden Flux, and Crown of Tempests are not appearing on Year 1 versions of the armor.\n* The Raiju\u2019s Harness exotic chest piece allows for infinite Whirlwind Guard usage. We have disabled this exotic until a fix can be deployed at a later date.\n* We are investigating an increase in ANTEATER, BEETLE and BEAVER error codes.\n* Only the character who unlocked the EDZ Bunker can use the PDS upgrade to clear the Bunker \u2013 other characters will receive an error.\n* The Warden servitor in Warden of Nothing is not counting as a Fallen boss for strike bounties.\n* We\u2019re investigating crashes issues occurring in Gambit for players on PS4 and Steam.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Yeetus Deletus\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pirKvHw.gif)\n\n\nLast week, we shared some lovely Trials clips from Destiny 1 tagged with #TrialsReturns. This week, we have the opportunity to showcase more Trials content, but this time from Destiny 2! Seems that Titans are good for more than just bodyshields. Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a Warlock clip in here too\u2026\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Flawless Thundercrash**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCfqSmQ_XtA)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Crispy Snipes**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgD39Gud6JI)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: If Pigs Could Fly**\n\n\n&gt;Oh how I missed you, Trials! [pic.twitter.com/YHzuoPJLIP](https://t.co/YHzuoPJLIP)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 BarbaricHam (@BarbaricHam) [March 13, 2020](https://twitter.com/BarbaricHam/status/1238597173303889920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n\nNext week, we\u2019ll get back in the flow of giving PvE some love. If you\u2019d like a chance for the MotW emblem, throw your clip, monotone montage, mix tape, or video on the [Creations Page](https://comics.bungie.net/).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been [working remotely](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48856) for about two weeks now. It\u2019s been a pretty weird time, not going to lie. While we\u2019ve gotten things straight on the backend to continue our workflows (and kick off a new Season), there isn\u2019t anything that can replace the face-to-face interactions we have \u2013-at Bungie. I do feel lucky, though, as we have ample opportunity to mix things up online.\n\n\nEven if your area has gone on lockdown in the face of COVID-19, you can still find Guardians running around Mercury completing their weekly flashpoint, or grinding out some raids in preparation for Trials of Osiris. Share your favorite emotes with one another, or maybe even jump in a fireteam to strike up some friendly conversation. One thing that I\u2019ve enjoyed most is the variety of songs players have suggested to keep motivated, or even as timers for washing their hands.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll get through this together, as Guardians.\n\n\nMuch love,\n\nDmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1375320,

If you haven\u2019t seen the trailer, there is a new threat for you to confront.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/p7Z1ufrNUns)\n\n\nBungie.net also has a [dedicated page for the new Season](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfTheWorthy), jam-packed with information to get you up to speed before next Tuesday\u2019s launch.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133349/Destiny_SoW_Calendar_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vDci7j2.jpg)\n\n\nBefore we get started with the rest of the TWAB, I wanted to take a quick moment to highlight [another blog post](http://bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48839) that went live earlier today. In response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, our teams have been working hard to build out an infrastructure that would enable Bungie employees to support Destiny 2, and the impending Season 10 release, safely from remote locations. Season of the Worthy is still planned to release on March 10, followed by the return of Trials of Osiris on March 13. While there is a possibility that this change could affect our patching cadence in the short term, we will be sure to keep players informed about those schedules as much as possible. Stay tuned to [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie) and [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp) for any future updates.\n\n\nNow, we have some housekeeping to do before we arm an ancient Warmind. Let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n###TrialsReturns\n\nMoments after the announcement that Trials of Osiris would return with Season of the Worthy, we witnessed numerous Guardians sharing their favorite memories from this beloved corner of the PvP endgame. Moments of spectacle, joy, heartbreak, insanity, and everything in between. Trials of Osiris was the source of some awesome community highlights\u2014a thing that some of our newer Guardians may have yet to experience. We\u2019d love to see more of your stories and bring them into the scene.\n\n\nUsing the hashtag [#TrialsReturns](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrialsReturns?src=hash&amp;lang=en), share your favorite clips from Destiny 1\u2019s Trials of Osiris. You can post them to Twitter, upload them to YouTube, and even post them to our Community Creations page. We\u2019ll round up our favorites to be featured in next week\u2019s TWAB.\n\n\nIf your video is selected, you and your fireteam will take home a Movie of the Week emblem. Make sure to include links to the Bungie.net profiles of every team member.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Power Gains\n\nWith each new Season, you\u2019re faced with new challenges that require a bit of Power acquisition to take on. In Season of Worthy, you\u2019ll be challenged in not only Trials of Osiris, but in Legendary Lost Sectors and Grandmaster Nightfalls. Here\u2019s a quick update from the Dev team on what\u2019s changing on day-one, and what our plans are for a mid-season update:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev team:** We\u2019re raising the \u2018cap\u2019 for gear drops 40 points\u2014powerful gear will now drop up to 1000, with pinnacle drops going up to 1010. The soft cap has also been effectively raised 50 points. Gear drops from nearly all sources will continue to be upgrades until 950 Power, and powerful reward sources will not be required to progress to 950. We\u2019re looking to present an element of gear progression available each Season, as well as prepare underlying systems for future updates like the forthcoming one for Legendary weapons mentioned by Luke Smith in the [Director\u2019s Cut](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48758) \u2018Weapons Forever\u2019 section.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re also looking to make some quality of life updates in the pinnacle band. Starting in 2.8.1. (coming mid-Season), we\u2019ll be upgrading some existing powerful rewards to pinnacle rewards. These are the weekly Crucible, Strike, and Gambit challenges, as well as the weekly clan engram. With this change, we want to increase the total number of pinnacle power sources in the game, broaden pinnacle drop access, as well as increase the pools of items that can drop in the pinnacle band.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Slot imbalances can also affect pinnacle progression. When we say slot imbalance, this could be explained as those times you have a chest piece drop from pinnacle sources a few times in a row. We\u2019ve been looking at player feedback for some time, and are investigating a few approaches to the problem space. We\u2019re looking to have an update on that at a later date. Until then, we hope the additional sources will help you on your climb.\n\n\nWhile we have the Dev team here, they also wanted to give an update on Artifact Power for Trials of Osiris.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev team:** With Trials just around the corner, we wanted to address the \u201cArtifact Power problem\u201d as quickly as we could. [As Luke said last week](https://twitter.com/thislukesmith/status/1233197373976768512), our short-term fix is to disable the Artifact's Power bonus while in Trials and Iron Banner. Unfortunately, Season of the Worthy has already been released for certification, so we won't be able to disable the Artifact's Power for the first Trials weekend. We have the fix in-house to disable it and are testing it this week, and hope to deploy it on Tuesday, March 17. We really wish we could have gotten it in for the launch weekend, but we also expect the first Trials weekend to be the one impacted by the Artifact the least. Players will have much less time to increase their Artifact Power, so the majority will be close to each other outside of Pinnacle drops.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Our long-term plan is to enable a Power cap for Trials and Iron Banner and we're investigating the work required for this. This will roll out no earlier than midway through Season of the Worthy, but we don't have a firm date yet\u2014we'll make sure to communicate it when we do! We also plan to look at the damage curves for Power-enabled PvP modes to determine what, if any, adjustments should be made. Assuming we discover it\u2019s necessary, the timeline for a change is still TBD. With both changes, we plan to provide more detailed write-ups before they go live, explaining the details of the change and the design philosophy behind why we are making those decisions.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Just for clarity, I'll echo Luke's statement from last week: we're going to disable the Artifact Power bonus in Trials and Iron Banner until we can implement a new Power cap system for those playlists. I hope you all enjoy Season of the Worthy, and may your run to the Lighthouse be swift and merciless.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Season of the Worthy: Eververse Update\n\nWith the turn of each Season, we hope to keep players up to date on how the Eververse Store is evolving. This Season, we have a few changes concerning Bright Engrams, and a new path to directly purchasing some previously featured Eververse items.\n\n\n**Bright Engrams**\n\nIn Season of the Worthy, Bright Engrams will no longer be available for purchase from the Eververse Store. As said in the [February 2020 Director\u2019s Cut](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48758):\n\n\n\u201cWe want players to know what something costs before they buy it. Bright Engrams don\u2019t live up to that principle so we will no longer be selling them on the Eververse Store, though they will still appear on the Free Track of the Season Pass.\u201d\n\n\nThis Season, we are continuing to focusing our efforts on direct purchasing through the Eververse Store.\n\n\n**Daily Rotation of Returning Items**\n\nIn the place of Bright Engrams, a new module will become available on the Eververse Store starting in Season of the Worthy. This daily-rotating module will feature one item from a small selection of ships, Sparrows, Ghosts, and finishers that were offered in previous Seasons. These items will be available to purchase directly for Silver at a discount from the original price.\n\n\nAside from these changes, there aren\u2019t any other major shifts coming for Eververse. We\u2019ll be monitoring the conversation through launch and beyond, and will be sure to update you before any large changes come. Here\u2019s a quick preview of some upcoming items coming with Season of the Worthy:\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133349/Street_Wear_16-9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4BsWtoT.jpg)\n\n\n**Hunter Finisher**\n\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133354/S10_Hunter_Finisher.mp4)\u00a0\n\n**Titan Finisher**\n\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133355/S10_Titan_Finisher.mp4)\u00a0\n\n**\u00a0Warlock Finisher**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/133/133356/S10_Warlock_Finisher.mp4)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##The Final Preview (of Patch Notes)\n\nOver the last few weeks, we\u2019ve been giving some previews how your sandbox will be evolving in Season of the Worthy. Not just weapon tuning, but the ability to change the Elemental Affinity on your armor pieces. This week, we\u2019ll be taking a wider look at Destiny 2 Update 2.8.0.

Don\u2019t patches usually ship at 9 AM?\u201d Daylight Saving Time begins on Sunday, March 8. If your region takes part in jumping forward, your weekly reset time will be an hour later than you\u2019re used to.

We saved a Legend, stopped the Psions from changing time itself, and had the opportunity to watch a lot of [Community Creations](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) along the way.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Creatures of Destiny: A Nature Documentary**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/EkcAHEQQFn4)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: This player should be banned for such an unsatisfying montage**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/SW_ZQLfuTtM)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Riven\u2019s Heart Theme Keyboard Cover**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/oSqUX-jL-q4)\n\n\nCheers to everyone who submitted a video, art piece, or anything to the [Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) during Season of Dawn. We\u2019re excited to see what you cook up over the next few months.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think that next week a new Season begins. It feels like just yesterday we were watching you all explore the Corridors of Time. It\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m pretty excited for Trials to return, and I\u2019m also looking forward to see you share your memories with the #TrialsReturns hashtag.\n\n\nSee you next week. Maybe we\u2019ll bump into each other on our way to the Lighthouse.

You all came together and donated your stockpiles of Fractaline to the ongoing effort to build the new Lighthouse and usher in the return of Trials of Osiris next Season. As soon as the final stage was complete, you were invited to survey the completion of the project and light the beacon. We saw your signal as our cue to release this developer insight video confirming what many have been speculating for a while now.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/_bYeNpgOjtc)\n\n\nTo follow the video, Luke Smith wrote another [Director\u2019s Cut](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48758) that covered a few topics, including our philosophy on Seasons and some challenges in sustaining a game with weapons that last forever. Similar to the [three](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48058)-[part ](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48064)[epic ](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48072)he put out last year, it contains a lot of important info you won\u2019t want to miss.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Subclass Changes\n\nWith the return of Trials and a new Season on the way, we\u2019re planning to shake things up with some changes to your Guardian abilities. The Dev team has the details, so I\u2019ll let them do the talking.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev Team**: Hey, Guardians. Trials is coming back, and the Combat Systems team has been hard at work preparing Destiny 2 for its arrival. We\u2019ve made a number of big changes to the abilities sandbox, and instead of simply dropping them all in the patch notes, we wanted to take this opportunity to offer some transparency for our decision-making process.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Before we begin, we want to give a big shout out to the data scientists here at Bungie. They provide us with mountains of valuable data to sift through\u2014from the win rates of each subclass in each Crucible game mode to the kills-per-minute of each weapon on each platform in each PvE activity. This data allows us to make sure we\u2019re making informed decisions when balancing the game. It allows us to separate the perceived power of abilities, weapons, and armor, from their true, objective power. But The data doesn\u2019t always tell the whole story, and we believe strongly that perceived power and community sentiment are just as important as cold, hard data. Even as Trials returns, we\u2019re committed to maintaining a fun and fair sandbox for both PvP and PvE, and we considered data for all game modes when making adjustments.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###**Warlock Melee**\n&gt;\n&gt;Warlocks have long been at a disadvantage in melee fights because it takes them slightly longer than Titans and Hunters to recover from making a melee attack. So, next Season, **we\u2019re extending the Warlock\u2019s basic melee range by one meter** to a total of 5.5 meters. Warlocks will still melee slightly slower than the other classes, but they\u2019ll now have a one-meter advantage. If you can use this window to land the first melee attack in a slap fight, you\u2019ll likely emerge victorious. We feel this is a more interesting solution to melee disparity than homogenizing all of the melee attacks, and we\u2019ll be studying the data as it rolls in to make sure it\u2019s balanced.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###**Titan Barricades**\n&gt;\n&gt;A Titan\u2019s barricade is incredibly powerful in Trials because you can use it to safely resurrect your fallen teammates. Next Season, **we\u2019re creating counters to the barricade while also raising its health from 500hp to 600hp**. Barricades will now take extra damage from Special-ammo weapons, anti-barrier weapons, and certain Heavy weapons. This change makes barricades sturdier while giving opposing players the option to use their Special ammo to bring down the barricade more quickly.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The following weapons now do 30% extra damage to Barricades:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Sniper Rifles\n&gt;* Grenade Launchers\n&gt;* Linear Fusion Rifles\n&gt;* Machine Guns\n&gt;* Trace Rifles\n&gt;* Anti-Barrier Weapons\n&gt;\n&gt;The following weapons now do 60% extra damage to Barricades:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Shotguns\n&gt;* Fusion Rifles\n&gt;\n&gt;You\u2019ll see yellow damage numbers when hitting a barricade with a counter weapon, which always feels good.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###One-Shot Abilities\n&gt;\n&gt;With the introduction of the Hunter\u2019s Weighted Knife in Season of Dawn, each class now has a neutral-game ability that can kill PvP opponents in one hit. **We\u2019ve taken a pass at all of the one-shot abilities to tune their risk/reward factor**. We\u2019ll warn you that some these changes look extreme on paper, but we made a point to make sure these abilities retained their overall feel.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the Titan\u2019s three Shoulder Charge abilities, we reduced the auto-targeting angle by 50%. That might sound like a lot, but acrobatic Titans could previously auto-target to make an **instant 90-degree turn**. We also adjusted the lunge distance to 5.5m for both targeted and untargeted lunges. Targeted lunges were previously 6m, while untargeted lunges were previously 4.5m. These changes make for a more consistent experience while lunging.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the Hunter\u2019s Weighted Knife, we\u2019ve reduced its tracking significantly and created new tracking tech that will make the knife more faithful to its initial throw trajectory.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As for the Warlock\u2019s Handheld Supernova, we\u2019ve made a number of changes to bring this ability in line with the other one-shot abilities. While part of HHSN\u2019s strength lies in its pairing with the Contraverse Hold Exotic gauntlets (which are also being tuned this Season), our data indicated that even without Contraverse Hold, Handheld Supernova needed to be adjusted. Here are the changes:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Increased activation time by 0.6 seconds\n&gt;* Reduced hold time from 3.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds\n&gt;* Reduced range by 20%\n&gt;* Tightened horizontal spread of bolts by 25%\n&gt;* Bolt explosion now does self-damage\n&gt;* Reduced bolt explosion radius from 3m to 2.5m\n&gt;\n&gt;In our playtesting, we\u2019ve found that the product of these changes is an ability that is still incredibly strong but now has a risk/reward ratio commensurate with its power. (After all, this thing can vaporize multiple PvP opponents instantly.) There\u2019s even a bit of silver lining here \u2014the tightening of the bolts leads to more concentrated damage at range, improving its viability against Supers. To compensate for this change, other elements of the middle Voidwalker path are being buffed, including the Nova Warp Super, which now has increased damage resistance, a longer duration, and a reduced blink cost.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###General Subclass Tuning\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019ve made changes to a number of subclass paths in an effort to tighten the gameplay balance. For example, **Stormcaller top, Striker bottom, and Arcstrider bottom** have remained dominant in PvP for multiple Seasons now, consistently beating out all other paths in both win-rate and average efficiency. These paths have also ranked among the top PvE paths in terms of kills-per-minute. We\u2019ve adjusted these paths (and others) to bring them closer to the middle of the pack. On the other end of the spectrum, paths such as **Voidwalker bottom, Nightstalker bottom, and Striker middle** needed some love, so we\u2019ve taken steps to lift them up.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In the spirit of transparency, we take no joy in nerfing the abilities, weapons, and armor that we all love to use. We wish the answer to keeping the game balanced and fresh was always to buff the underperforming elements. But such an approach leads to power creep\u2014the slow and steady increase of the average power of everything in the game\u2014which trivializes the incredible game modes and encounters that the other teams at Bungie work hard to create. After all, as Destiny players ourselves, we go home and play the game too, and we want the game to be as fun and as healthy as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That\u2019s it from us today. You\u2019ll find more details about these changes and more when the patch notes drop in early March.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh yeah . . . and **Hunter Tripmines are sticky again**. Stay sharp, Guardians.\n\n\nAs promised, in addition to these explanations, there will be patch notes when the new Season begins. Those should give you the full illustration of how the game is changing. Until they arrive, we hope you enjoyed this preview.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Twitch Prime Rewards\n\n\nMore Twitch Prime Rewards go live this week.

Here\u2019s an update on your shared progress:\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132630/Stats.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XKqKqjp.jpg)\n\n\nWhether you\u2019ve been donating or investing, this has been a community-wide effort from the get go. Your combined efforts are paving the way to success. Soon, the final Triumph for the Savior title and a fancy new shader will be available for everyone, and it\u2019s all thanks to you.\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s shift gears. A few weeks back, we promised some Sandbox previews leading up to Season of [Redacted]. Let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Taking a Pass\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132630/03292018_sandbox_header.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/S3iYdgD.jpg)\n\nThis week, we\u2019re putting the magnifying glass on weapons. While Swords were given a bit of an overhaul in functionality, other weapon archetypes are seeing some finer tuning. Damage values, ranges, and even reload canceling are on the table this time around. We know one of the first questions on your mind will be, \u201cIs this a Crucible-centric update, or will PvE get changes this Season as well?\u201d\n\n\nWhile the following changes will be coming out at the beginning of Season of [Redacted], some are in preparation for a new PvE challenge coming later in the Season. A new Nightfall difficulty, officially dubbed \u201cGrandmaster,\u201d will test even the most proficient Guardians. We\u2019ll have more details about this new ordeal in the coming weeks. But for now, we have information from the Dev team on changes being made to ensure that we strike the right balance between challenge and reward.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev Team**: For Season of [Redacted], we\u2019ve adjusted quite a few weapon archetypes alongside the changes to Swords that were announced two weeks ago. While these are not all the changes in the release, we\u2019re covering some important conversation pieces here.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Izanagi\u2019s Burden**\n&gt;\n&gt;Since the removal of auto-reload effects from Rally Barricade and Lunafaction Boots, as well as the introduction of a catalyst for Izanagi\u2019s Burden, it\u2019s seen a significant uptick in use. Izanagi\u2019s Burden solidified itself within the majority of endgame builds due to its excellent burst damage, sustained damage, ammo economy due to Special ammo, and safety due to being a Sniper Rifle. The Outlaw trait was swapped out for No Distractions to be more in-line with the fantasy of the weapon and to ensure the trait on the weapon would still work with Honed Edge.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The animation speed of Honed Edge is no longer affected by the reload stat\n&gt;* Outlaw has been replaced with No Distractions\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sniper Rifles**\n&gt;\n&gt;We gave Sniper Rifles an increase in PvE damage back in Shadowkeep. We\u2019re removing that change for a few reasons. Sniper Rifles have a lot of utility and safety due to their range and the increased damage was giving them too much of a leg-up on their closer range counterparts. That gulf only widens as the difficulty of any given encounter goes up. The direct changes to Adaptive and Rapid-Fire Snipers were to make the differences in the sub-archetypes more impactful again as well as to give some amount of parity with the adjustments to Shotguns and Fusion Rifles.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Damage to Major enemies and above have been reduced to pre Shadowkeep values (~-20%).\n&gt;* Adaptive Snipers precision multiplier has been reduced from 3.25x to 2.95x.\n&gt;* Rapid-Fire Snipers base impact has been reduced from 100 damage to 90 damage.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Grenade Launchers**\n&gt;\n&gt;Through a combination of archetype adjustments and new perks being introduced, Grenade Launchers have been quite powerful ever since Season of the Drifter. We\u2019ve changed the Aggressive frame sub-archetype to the Rapid-Fire sub-archetype to be more in line with other weapon\u2019s established conventions and slightly reduced their effectiveness on Powerful enemies to give other weapons some more breathing room.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Aggressive Frame grenade launchers are now Rapid-Fire Frame Grenade Launchers.\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Rapid-Fire Frame Grenade Launchers have had their damage reduced to account for their Rate of Fire (0.8x), but now also have increased reserves.\n&gt;   * Previously, Aggressive Frame Grenade Launchers fired faster than Adaptive but had the same damage.\n&gt;* Damage to Major enemies and above by Power weapon Grenade Launchers reduced by ~10%.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Lord of Wolves**\n&gt;\n&gt;The ease of use granted by changes to Release the Wolves made it very difficult to approach and made the margin of error extremely large. We\u2019ve pushed the two states apart via accuracy to ensure that the default state is the norm, rather than the exception. With this change, Release the Wolves should be used at extremely close ranges against large targets instead of just being a better version of the default behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Release the Wolves now significantly reduces this weapon\u2019s accuracy while active.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**The Last Word**\n&gt;\n&gt;When reintroduced in Season of the Forge, The Last Word became quite dominant due to its extremely forgiving maximum time-to-kill (TTK). We\u2019re adjusting the way the weapon works to focus it back as a hip-fire based weapon while also improving that side of the experience for both controller and mouse and keyboard inputs. We also made it a little less forgiving so that you still have to concentrate on your aim while wielding the weapon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Fan Fire now adjusts the precision scalar while hip-firing.\n&gt;* Fan Fire impact values have been adjusted.\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Precision Hip/ADS adjusted from 67.95/67.95 to 68.27/52.2.\n&gt;   * Non-Precision Hip/ADS adjusted from 50.01/50.01 to 38/38.\n&gt;* Aiming down sights no longer provides additional effective range (damage falloff).\n&gt;* Reduced stability for Mouse and Keyboard input.\n&gt;* Reduced the effective range.\n&gt;* To improve the experience, adjusted the way target acquisition is handled while hip-firing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Shotguns**\n&gt;\n&gt;One issue we\u2019ve been waiting to fix before adjusting Shotguns again was an oddity in the way our aim assist system works with weapons that don\u2019t care much about precision damage. As an example for Shotguns, at certain distances between players, the aim assist system would prioritize the head, causing the entire spread to deviate from center mass and make the player miss out on the kill. With that issue out of the way, we made more adjustments to Shotguns to give other weapons a little more time to react to them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Target acquisition for non-slug Shotguns has been adjusted to no longer account for precision locations.\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Previously, target acquisition could actually cause the player's spread to deviate from the intended aim vector, causing most of the spread to miss.\n&gt;* Cone angle is now adjusted on a per sub-archetype basis and is no longer adjusted by the range stat.\n&gt;* Aiming down sights no longer adjusts effective range for this weapon archetype.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Fusion Rifles**\n&gt;\n&gt;Similar to the issue noted above with Shotguns, Fusion Rifles also suffered from some target acquisition related oddities that we\u2019ve since fixed. Most of the changes here are adjustments focusing on the High Impact sub-archetype. Backup Plan was an Exotic perk in the original Destiny release, and it was placed on Legendary Fusion Rifles in Destiny 2 due to them being Heavy ammo weapons at the time rather than the Special ammo weapons they currently are. When weapons were shuffled around in Forsaken, the perk came along with them, and we\u2019ve decided to adjust it alongside the archetype itself to have it fall back in line with other Legendary perks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Target acquisition for Fusion Rifles has been adjusted to no longer account for precision locations.\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Previously, target acquisition could actually cause the player's volley to deviate from the intended aim vector, causing most of the volley to miss.\n&gt;* Damage falloff for this weapon archetype can now floor at 0.5x (Previously 0.75x).\n&gt;* Effective range and the impact of the optics stat for this weapon archetype has been reduced across the board.\n&gt;* Backup Plan\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Backup Plan now adjusts impact to match the Rapid-Fire sub-archetype while active.\n&gt;   * Charge time is now set to match the Rapid-Fire's sub-archetype * 0.85 while active.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Auto Rifles**\n&gt;\n&gt;Some small tweaks have been made to give Auto Rifles a small boost in efficacy for the Crucible\u2014though they also influence PvE. The nature of the way Destiny is played tends to have Semi-Auto based weaponry be more effective in general and so we\u2019re compensating for that with these tweaks. These are fairly modest changes intended to give Auto Rifles more of a chance in an open fight without attempting to drag the TTK of the entire game down.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The following impact values have changed:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* High-Impact Frame\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * 22/35.2 Default/Precision (Previously 22/33)\n&gt;* Precision Frame\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * 17/27.2 Default/Precision (Previously 17/25.5)\n&gt;* Adaptive Frame\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * 15.75/25.2 Default/Precision (Previously 13.75/22)\n&gt;* Rapid-Fire Frame\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * 13.4/20.1 Default/Precision (Previously 12.5/18.75)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;These are some of the biggest changes coming to weapons, but be sure to check out the official patch notes in early March for the full list. We\u2019ll also have a preview of Exotic armor changes, along with tuning to your Supers and abilities in the coming weeks.

Players who are still running into this issue on Xbox should reboot their console and log back into Destiny 2 to verify their Silver balance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players experiencing negative Silver balances due to refunds or chargebacks should refer to our [Destiny Silver Purchases Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13660).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**\u201cIN THE VALLEY\u201d CRIMSON DAYS EMBLEM**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tuesday, Destiny Player Support received reports that code generation and redemption for the \u201cIn the Valley\u201d Crimson Days emblem had ended approximately nine hours earlier than expected. To ensure players who had already generated a code had a chance to redeem their code or a friend\u2019s code, the deadline to redeem was extended until Wednesday\u2019s daily reset.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Full Hymn of Desecration stacks are being removed from player\u2019s inventories upon earning the final one.\n&gt;* World chests in the Dreaming City are not dropping Glimmer.\n&gt;* The Aeon Safe Gauntlets list the incorrect requirement to activate the Aeon Energy perk in the armor inspection screen. Players need to get melee kills to activate the Aeon Energy perk.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##They Believed They Could Fly\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129401/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4DXyMNS.gif)\n\n\nTitans like to punch things, right? Sometimes, things aren\u2019t within reach of their fists. This week\u2019s winners bridge the gap with some killer editing that really drove it home.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Titans Just Want to Punch Things**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r-WOttQ5Bs&amp;amp;feature=emb_title)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: An Perfectly Average PvP Montage**\n\n[[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xrSpCnM0js&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xrSpCnM0js&amp;feature=emb_logo)\n\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Wedding in the Dreaming City**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei-Xu463P00)\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you want a cool emblem. You should do what this week\u2019s winners did: make a cool video and submit it to the [Creations page on Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nI\u2019m still having a bit of trouble processing the fact that you\u2019ve all raised billions of Fractaline in the last few weeks. On top of that, you\u2019ve completed countless Timelost weapon bounties in the process. Spider is swimming in shards. Your XP gains are overflowing.\n\n\nI can only hope to one day own a successful business like our Fallen friend.\n\n\nWhile all this has been happening, Osiris confronted an old ally(?) to provoke them to pick a side. Have you seen the new cinematic in the game? It\u2019s out there. In the weeks to come, your victory over the Red Legion on Mercury will be complete. A new Season is on rapid approach and with it comes new mysteries, threats, and activities to plunder for rewards. If you\u2019re enjoying those Obelisks, you still have time to farm their resonance levels and weapon bounties before the next Season begins. We\u2019ll share more with you real soon\u2026\n\n\nCheers,\n\nDmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w",

"Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48727\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we had to fix the timeline . . . again.\u00a0\n\n\nSometimes when you kill a bug it doesn\u2019t stay dead. Earlier this week, while deploying Hotfix 2.7.1.1, a small number of servers failed to restart with the proper configuration file. This reintroduced a previous issue that caused some players to lose currency. We had to reset the clock again, and roll back character data to ensure that no one\u2019s hard-earned currencies were lost. To give you some details from behind the scenes, we posted a [detailed recap of why this issue reemerged](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48723) and how we\u2019re working to prevent it from rearing its ugly head again. Player Support has more info below on Hotfix 2.7.1.2 going live this morning and how it put this bug to bed for good.\u00a0\n\n\nIn other news, Crimson Days is back and Guardians are partnering up to show their love. The Tower decorations are up and Lord Shaxx is inviting partners to enter his special Crimson Doubles playlist in the Crucible. For the full details, check out our [Crimson Days page](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/CrimsonDays) or [last week\u2019s TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48708).\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Fronktaline\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132369/Stonks.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TTCq7NN.jpg)\n\n\nTo invest or to donate? That is the question the community has been pondering since the Empyrean Foundation event began last week. Many in the community are recommending that players keep investing in Obelisks, but we\u2019re seeing a steady rise in donations as players have already hit stage five. We\u2019ve also received reports from Spider that this economic stimulus has been great for his business.\n\n\nHere is a look at current Fractaline donation tracking as of noon PST.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132369/Frac_2.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sUyngRx.jpg)\n\n\nBillions of Fractaline have been donated, but you have billions more to go to reach stage seven and unlock the final Triumph for the Savior Seal.\n\n\n***\n\n\n##An Affinity for You\n\nWhen we introduced Armor 2.0 with Shadowkeep last fall, we got a lot of feedback on the new armor system \u2013 specifically pertaining to Elemental Affinities. Many of you have been asking for the ability to change Elemental Affinity types on armor. We\u2019ll be adding the ability to do this starting next Season.\u00a0\n\n\nYou\u2019ll soon be able to change the Elemental Affinity on any piece of armor to either of the other two Affinity types directly from the item\u2019s inspection screen by hovering your cursor over the armor's energy icon. This is intended to mitigate the experience of getting an armor drop with a stat roll you want, but the wrong Elemental Affinity. Changing an armor Affinity type will cost 1 Upgrade Module. If your armor is already upgraded to a higher energy level, the cost will be the total upgrade materials necessary to reach that energy value plus 1 Upgrade Module.\u00a0\n\n###Seasonal Mods\n\nWe also received a lot of suggestions on how to improve Seasonal mods. Starting next Season, the Seasonal armor mod socket (e.g. Undying Mods, Dawn Mods) will also be able to use mods released during the Seasons before and after the armor piece was released.\n\n\nFor example, armor with a mod socket from Season of Dawn can now equip Dawn Mods, Undying Mods from Season of the Undying, and [Redacted] Mods (from Season of [Redacted])\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Iron Banner\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132369/Iron_Banner_Dawn.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SHvIk4K.jpg)\n\n\nAs Crimson Days comes to a close, Lord Saladin will arrive just in time to fill the hole in the heart of a less decorated Tower. Red flowers will be replaced with a burning shield as the last Iron Banner of this Season kicks off next week.\n\n\n**Iron Banner and Valor Bonus**\n\n**Start: 9 AM PST on February 18**\n\n**End: 9 AM PST on February 25**\n\n\nThis is your last shot to finish your Iron Banner quest this Season and pick up any pinnacle rewards from Iron Banner bounties. Equip your best gear and control those zones!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##GROUNDHOG DAY\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130381/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hUb2MJt.gif)\n\n\n\nPlayer Support is the first to field reports of issues in the game. The Help forum is the best way to throw up signal flares if you suspect something is awry.\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###HOTFIXES AND ROLLING BACK ACCOUNTS\n&gt;\n&gt;After [Hotfix 2.7.1.1](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48719) went live on Tuesday, the Player Support team started receiving reports of players missing their Destiny 2 materials and currencies, again. We alerted the rest of the development teams about the issue and the decision was made to immediately [take the game down](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1227298035769565185) to prevent more players from being affected. Around [4 PM PST](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1227382421944815617), we finished [rolling back player accounts](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1227323997433597954) and brought the game back online.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Earlier today, we released Hotfix 2.7.1.2 which included a server code fix to prevent currencies and materials from disappearing again, as well as a fix for the infinite Dawnblade Super issue.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###BOND, CRIMSON BOND\n&gt;\n&gt;Lord Shaxx has decorated the Tower and brought Crimson Days back to the Crucible. Along with a partner, you can forge a Crimson Bond with them in the Crimson Days Doubles playlist, earn Confectionary Hearts, and purchase unique rewards. The event will **end at the [weekly reset](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46165) on February 18.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information about Crimson Days, [view our Help article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46615).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players who completed quests or lost progress, gear, or weapons between 8:30 and 10:30 AM PST on Tuesday, February 11, **will have to complete or earn them again** due to our account rollback.\n&gt;* The \"**Fire of the Crimson Days**\" emblem can't be accepted if it's already your inventory. Delete the emblem and accept the new one to continue.\n&gt;* **Unearned/unclaimed Crimson Days triumphs** will be removed when Crimson Days ends and won't be able to be claimed afterward.\n&gt;* Players having trouble collecting their **Undeterred, SVC-12, or IVC-10 Sparrows** need to make room in their Sparrows and Consumables inventory to receive them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Best Picture\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129401/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tTVyvt1.gif)\n\n\nOur movie awards may not have all of the pomp and circumstance of the Oscars, but dmg04 always dresses up when he picks the winners. Also, you don\u2019t have to wait a year for more Movies of the Week. So that\u2019s a bonus. Anyway, our award process is pretty simple \u2013 we pick our favorite community-made videos and the winners get an emblem. Just please make sure you include your Bungie.net profile link in the description of the video if you win.\n\n\nMovie of the Week: Little Legend\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmBSmgDKXFM)\n\n\nHonorable Mention: I got a Fever\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/Ordj3hmn08w)\n\n\nHard to believe we only have one month left in Season of Dawn. If you\u2019re planning on getting the title before the end of the Season, make sure you start finishing up any Triumphs you need. Looking at the numbers, the community should be unlocking the Empyrean Foundation Triumph soon.\n\n\nWe gave you quick look at some upcoming armor changes and we\u2019ll continue to unveil details on what else to expect next Season in the weeks to come[.](https://i.imgur.com/hrI910E.jpg)\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

timeline.\n\n\nEarlier this week, when we deployed 2.7.1, we discovered an issue causing players to lose various currencies. Our team immediately took action and brought the game down for maintenance while we worked to discover the source of the issue. We did this to minimize any further impact to players. We ended up doing the first-ever character rollback in *Destiny\u2019s* history to ensure that no one lost any of their hard-earned materials. We\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience caused by the unexpected maintenance and appreciated everyone\u2019s patience while we worked to get the game back online.\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to improve our efforts to minimize issues and downtime. Even though some bugs are always going to crawl through the cracks, we\u2019ll be waiting on the other side with a swatter.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Empyrean Foundation\n\nNext week, the Empyrean Foundation rebuild effort begins. Saint-14 will ask all Guardians to contribute to building a beacon that will be a foundation for things to come next Season. The Tower Obelisk will be the focal point of this event, so make sure you have it unlocked and ready to go as it\u2019s going to have some hefty benefits to take advantage of.\n\n\nPlayers will need to come together and contribute resources towards a common goal. To participate, players can donate their Fractaline using the Tower Obelisk. The event will have seven stages, each requiring increasing amounts of Fractaline to progress through. There will also be a hologram at the Tower Obelisk where you\u2019ll be able to track the community\u2019s progress in game.\n\n\nOf course we aren\u2019t going to ask you to fork over your hard-earned Fractaline without providing some benefits. Here\u2019s what\u2019s in it for you:\n\n\n* Contributing to the Empyrean Foundation costs 100 Polarized Fractaline.\n* Contributing generates a 25% flat progression for all Timelost weapon bounties in your inventory.\n* Your Tower Obelisk will generate Polarized Fractaline for you each week equivalent to its Resonance Power.\n* Increase its Resonance Power by upgrading other Obelisks\n* Players who donate more than 5,000 Polarized Fractaline before the end of the Season will earn a Triumph and emblem.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/131/131976/Frac-Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SlsjE3q.jpg)\n\n\nEveryone in the community will also receive a shader when all stages are completed. Here\u2019s a look at community goals for the seven stages.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stage 1: 400,000,000\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stage 2: 700,000,000\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stage 3: 1,200,000,000\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stage 4: ???\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stage 5: ???\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stage 6: ???\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Stage 7: ???\n\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute. This event will be available to all *Destiny 2* players and doesn\u2019t require the Season Pass. You can start prepping this week by stockpiling Fractaline and making sure that your Tower Obelisk is powered up and ready to go[.](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bread-cat.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=2000&amp;h=1333)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Prime Time\n\nYesterday, [we announced](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48663) that we are teaming up with Twitch Prime to deliver in-game rewards to *Destiny 2* players with an active Prime membership. We are planning to have six monthly drops, with each drop containing four rewards.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/131/131881/detail_tab1_card1_2x.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0qmlTml.jpg)\n\n\nThe first gear drop is live now and will be available until February 25. It includes the SUROS Regime Auto Rifle, the Coup de Main Ornament, the Skyline Flipside Exotic Ghost Shell, and the unsecured/OUTCRY Exotic ship.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Guardian Giveaways\n\nThis week, the Bungie Store is celebrating Guardians everywhere with a giveaway contest featuring curated collections of *Destiny* gear, including sold-out *Shadowkeep* Collector\u2019s Editions signed by the Bungie team.

Thanks for helping us support Australia\u2019s firefighting and animal rescue efforts.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Rollback to the Future\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130381/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Bjwz7ec.gif)\n\n**Player Support** has a key role of working with the entire team to make sure you are aware of deployments and efforts to restore service during outages.\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**UPDATE 2.7.1 AND ROLLING BACK ACCOUNTS**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;After [Update 2.7.1](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48657) went live on Tuesday, January 28, the Player Support team began [noticing a trend](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1222210477318533120) of topics where users had lost various *Destiny 2* currencies and infusion materials. After verifying this issue, it was decided by several Bungie teams to [take the game down](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1222220435028234241) in an attempt to prevent more players from being affected.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Due to this issue affecting all accounts, and with no way to determine how much each account lost in a timely manner, it was decided to [roll back everyone\u2019s account](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1222280928791162880) from our last account backup [around 8:30 AM PST](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1222298510214615042).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Due to the rollback:\n\n\n* Any progress or quest that completed between 8:30 and 10:30 AM PST would have to be redone.\n* Any item gained during that timeframe would have to be earned again.\n* Purchases made during that timeframe would have to be redone, and Silver spent would be restored.\n* Platform store-purchased Silver bundles would not be affected since they are completed on the platform\u2019s end.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;After the [rollback completed](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1222345083917234176), *Destiny 2* server came back online around 7:00 PM PST. We are continuing to investigate why this issue occurred and may provide more information about it in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**TWITCH PRIME SUPPORT**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To receive the gear drops mentioned in the Prime Time section above, players will need an active Amazon Prime account, Bungie.net account, and a *Destiny 2* account. Once these accounts are linked, players can claim their drops on the [*Destiny 2* Twitch Prime website](https://twitch.amazon.com/prime/loot/destiny2), then log into *Destiny 2* and speak to Amanda Holliday in the Tower Hangar to claim the drops.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information about how to link accounts and claim your Exotic gear drops, view our [Twitch Prime Support for *Destiny 2*](http://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=48656) article on [Help.Bungie.Net](http://www.bungie.net/en/Support).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we continue investigating various known issues, here is a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our #Help Forum:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* **The Pigeon and the Phoenix** lore book triumphs can no longer be viewed by players who unlocked them. This will be resolved in a future update.\n* **Tower load times** have increased after Update 2.7.1.\n* The **Green With Envy** quest is not properly recording Infamy rank for some players after Update 2.7.1.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in *Destiny 2*, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Year of the Rat Kings\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129401/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/b3R6Twu.gif)\n\n\nYou ever see a video so funny that you sprayed milk out of your nose? I haven\u2019t, but I have a strict no-drinking-milk-while-watching-videos policy. Take a look at our winning movie this week (and careful with the milk!)\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Rat Attack**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj1vjarEP70)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Awakening**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/8il7bURWIVE)\n\n\nMovie of the Week winners will find a new emblem in their collections. Just make sure to put a link to your Bungie.net profile pages if you win so we know where to send them. We\u2019ll pick our favorite video from anywhere on the safe-for-work internet where *Destiny* videos are posted. But if you really want that emblem, the best place to submit your video is the [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nWhen you read this, I\u2019ll be traveling to visit family in Texas and Oklahoma next week. But don\u2019t worry, the Community team has been growing fat with strength and will have everything covered while I\u2019m out. I won\u2019t be fully out of action though. I\u2019ll be contributing to the Empyrean Foundation community event from the road using Stadia.\n\n\nWe look forward to watching the community mobilize in force to answer our challenge. We always try to set the bar high, since you have crushed our expectations in the past. Let\u2019s see what you got this time.\u00a0\n\n\n&lt;3 Cozmo", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w",

Guardians from around the world took on the monumental challenge of navigating time itself, some losing their minds in the progress. We\u2019d never shipped a puzzle of this size before, and watching the community engagement was a thrill in itself. We\u2019ve seen a few requests for commentary on the creation and development of this puzzle. As always, we\u2019re happy to invite you behind the scenes and share some of the thinking that goes into the experiences you play.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team:** Over the past week, we\u2019ve watched in awe as the community came together to solve one of Destiny\u2019s most complex puzzles to date. Everyone who took the time to participate in the solution will be remembered for years to come \u2013 whether you submitted a screenshot, transcribed puzzle pieces, generated maps, wrote code, worked the data, or cat-wrangled this monumental team effort. Please take a moment to congratulate yourselves. Your efforts and accomplishments were truly inspiring. Watching the first players solve the puzzle in the early hours of Monday morning was a career highlight for many of us on the Development Team.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With the puzzle solved and the Corridors of Time closing next week, we wanted to take a moment to talk about our goals and early designs for this puzzle.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When we started planning the puzzle, we created a few goals to guide our development:\n\n\n* Create a time maze through which any player can dive to discover secrets and lore\n* Serve as a shared community puzzle that rewards the Exotic Fusion Rifle\n* Celebrate community achievement and invite all players to partake in the reward\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With these goals in mind, we took inspiration from multiple sources in creating the early designs for the puzzle.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The bones originated several years ago with the discovery of the Sleeper Simulant and the ensuing quest to unlock it. At the time, we recognized that the moment of discovery was reserved for the few people that happened to be online at the time when that hidden content unlocked. Similarly, the secret missions for The Whisper and Zero Hour were also moments of discovery reserved for the few people online within a limited time window to experience first. By contrast, this puzzle was meant to be experienced by everybody who wanted to be included.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As is tradition at Bungie during our annual studio Pentathlon (which was held last Friday), many of us spend the entire day solving puzzles crafted by some of our brightest minds. This always culminates in a meta-puzzle that cannot be solved without the contribution of all of the smaller solutions. Similarly, the Corridors of Time puzzle was designed from the start to be very simple in nature, but also require require that all of the little bits come together in harmony before revealing its solution.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The delivery of this puzzle came together as the team began exploring the concept and narrative for Season of Dawn. The puzzle seemed to fit well with the idea of the Corridors of Time, with players meandering and weaving through time to find a very specific reality. The early ideas for this space were roughly based on the idea of the cult-classic movie *Cube*, where you would leave one door and end up in another identical room with a new death trap waiting for you. As always, our artists delivered a mind-bending and stunning visual language that simply brought the whole experience together into something that inspires the imagination. Much like other classic movies, such as Alice in Wonderland or the Matrix, this space and the way it was connected together was done so to invoke questions like \u201cJust how deep does this rabbit hole go? Can you just keep going on forever?\", and \"Is there even an end to this?\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Again, we want to thank everyone who participated in this puzzle or cheered from the sidelines. We\u2019re actively monitoring and collecting your feedback, from the puzzle itself to the rewards contained, to inform how we build experiences like this again in the future.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, we look ahead. We\u2019ve got a rundown of performance issues that are currently under investigation, and another patch note preview for next week's update!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Performance Pass\n\n\nOver the last few months, we\u2019ve been gathering feedback associated with game performance. This translates to moments when you may see framerate drops during activities or long load times when accessing a menu. The team has been deep in the code, looking for potential causes of these issues.\u00a0\n\n\nNext week, we\u2019ll have a few performance issues addressed in Destiny 2 Update 2.7.1, including:\n\n\n* Improved some performance issues in the Chamber of Suffering encounter.\n* Fixed an issue where players could die when transitioning from the Necropolis encounter to the Tunnels of Despair.\n* Improved a performance issue that could occur when chunks of land return, or are removed during the Sanctified Mind encounter.\n* Improved performance when receiving certain investment related messages. This could be reward acquisition, placing tributes, or interacting with Obelisks.\n\n\n   * The largest impact will be in the Tower, but this should help everywhere.\n* Players who load into Crucible matches faster than their peers will no longer be put in black screen. Rather, they will remain in spaceflight until all players have loaded into the match, as before.\n\n\nSome proposed fixes are currently in development for the below items. These need to pass through rigorous testing before they\u2019ll find their way to a future edition of patch notes:\u00a0\n\n\n* UI stuttering and framerate drops when loading or applying mods\n* Framerate issues in Gambit and Gambit Prime\n* Framerate issues during the Sanctified Mind encounter of the Garden of Salvation Raid\n* Framerate issues in the Pit of Heresy Dungeon, specifically in tunnel encounters\n* General improvements to performance on PC when a lot of debris is on the ground\n\n\nWhile our goal is to address these at the beginning of the next season, these fixes may be delayed if further issues arise. We\u2019ll be sure to keep you updated as we approach Season of [Redacted]. There are also other performance issues we're currently investigating that aren't listed above. If you've been encountering framerate drops or stuttering issues during gameplay, please make sure to post a report to the [#Help forum on Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help). Please include which platform you were playing on, what activity you were in, and a video if possible.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patch Note Preview, v2\n\nLast week, we had a short and sweet preview of what\u2019s coming in Destiny 2 Update 2.7.1. While Hard Light is creating some excitement, we have a few more patch notes addressing Quests, Seals, Exotic perks, and more.\n\n\n**Investment**\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue that is preventing Eris from granting her final Lore entry\n* Fixed an issue where the \u201cGreen with Envy\u201d Quest was not progressing for some players\n* Fixed an issue where the \u201cPlayin\u2019 the Odds\u201d emblem was not unlocking correctly for players\n\n\n   * This could prevent some players from fully unlocking the Dredgen title\n* Improved Black Armory Rare Bounty acquisition\n\n\n   * Chances increase as you complete weekly and daily bounties\n   * Guaranteed to drop from bounty completion after 5 days if completing all Ada-1 bounties\n\n\n\n**Sandbox**\n\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where the Heavy Handed mod could trigger from Telesto bolts\n* Fixed an issue where players could retain buffs from Wormgod Caress, Winter\u2019s Guile, and Synthoceps even after swapping armor\n\n   * Equip restrictions on Wormgod Caress and Winter\u2019s Guile will be lifted once this patch has shipped\n\n\nWe\u2019ll have a few more notes to share; expect the full list on Tuesday when Update 2.7.1 becomes available.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##A Memento in Time\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130381/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HQPhBHK.gif)\n\n\nKeeping track of every timetable in development could make your head spin. Luckily, you have Destiny Player Support at your service, and they don\u2019t shy away from the task. Known issues, release timelines, and more can be found below.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**PASSAGEWAY OF THE AGES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With the Destiny Community changing the timeline, the Corridors of Time have become unstable and will only be available **until the [weekly reset](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46165) on Tuesday, January 28**.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players have until this time to collect the 19 \u201cThe Pigeon and the Phoenix\u201d Lore pieces and the \u201cSavior of the Past\u201d emblem, along with a heartfelt message from Saint-14.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**UNLOCKING BASTION**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We have noticed that some players are having issues getting their Bastion Exotic Fusion Rifle quest from Saint-14. To claim the quest, players need to fully complete the Saint-14 storyline. This includes completing the following quests that can be claimed from Osiris:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Recovering the Past\n* An Impossible Task\n* Completing An Impossible Task\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;After completing these three quests and claiming their triumphs, players can visit Saint-14 in the Tower to pick up the \u201cMemento\u201d quest located in his inventory.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players having issues may need to [clear their console cache](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/12539) or [verify the integrity of their game files](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335) on Steam then visit Saint-14.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**UPDATE 2.7.1 AND RESOLVED ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Tuesday, January 28, we will release Destiny 2 Update 2.7.1. This update will resolve some issues currently affecting players. Here is another preview of some of the issues that will be resolved:\n\n\n* Players who have the **Leviathan\u2019s Breath Exotic quest** will now be able to access \u201cThe Arms Dealer\u201d Strike. This quest will become available to all Season Pass owners, regardless of which Season Pass they own. Players can pick this quest up from Banshee-44 in the Tower Courtyard after reaching Power 800.\n* Progress will now count toward the **Season 9: Challenges**, **Season 9: Rituals**, and **Season 9: Engagement Triumphs** and the requirements for each one have been reduced so they can be completed during Season of Dawn.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, here\u2019s the [timeline for the Destiny 2 Update 2.7.1](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/13125) release on Tuesday:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* **8:00 AM PST (1600 UTC):** Destiny 2 maintenance will begin. Players may experience sign-on issues during maintenance.\n* **8:45 AM (1645 UTC):** Players will be removed from activities and will be unable to log in until 9 AM.\n* **9:00 AM (1700 UTC):** Destiny 2 Update 2.7.1 will be released and players will be able to log in.\n* **11:00 AM (1800 UTC):** Destiny 2 maintenance will end.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Here is a list of the latest known issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The **Efrideet\u2019s Gift triumph** isn\u2019t unlocking for players who collect 50 Iron Banner packages from Lord Saladin.\n&gt;* When **resetting Infamy rank**, progress gets reset for the \u201cGet Closer\u201d step for the Green With Envy quest.\n&gt;* The **Sundial Fractaline Extractor III**, obtained from the Nessus Obelisk, incorrectly states an increased chance to find Polarized Fractaline when completing Vanguard Strikes. The enhancement actually increases the chance to find Polarized Fractaline when completing the Sundial and the Menagerie.\n&gt;* The **three Dreaming Tokens** given to players during the Wish-Ender quest, sometimes do not all go into a player\u2019s inventory and cannot be reacquired on that character.\n&gt;* The **Warlock\u2019s Arc Web** no longer chain-lightnings enemies.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Precision and Focus\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129401/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/perL02B.gif)\n\n\nThis week, our selections are keeping an eye on their respective battlegrounds. In one, the slightest movement can result in a headshot. For the other, coordinating flesh and metal to produce an amazing musical cover, something you could headbang to as you march to victory.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Revocation**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/-LSLkC3K5ZI)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Zulmak Metal**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/DwnlzEonJOU)\n\n\nWinners will find a shiny new emblem in their collections within the next 365 business days! Really, I\u2019ll get to it as soon as I can.

There\u2019s been an abundance of snow in the greater Seattle area, so many of us with long commutes have been keeping up the pace through the miracle of the internet and conference calls. The show must go on.\u00a0\n\n\nThere\u2019s a mysterious new quest being offered by the wily Warlock who\u2019s always messing about with time itself. The community\u2019s already on the case and working together to explore the Corridors of Time. We don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but do want to let everyone know that this one\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. We\u2019ll keep an eye on things and so far we\u2019re impressed with your progress!\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Iron Banner\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/131/131582/Iron_Banner_Dawn.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/y4IpW5R.jpg)\n\n\nThe Dawning has come to a close, and that clears up some room in the Tower for Lord Saladin to return and kick off the next Iron Banner.\n\n\n**Iron Banner and Valor Bonus**\n\n**Start: 9 AM PST on January 21**\n\n**End: 9 AM PST on January 28**\n\n\nBased on feedback collected during the first Iron Banner from this Season, we\u2019ll be auto-completing everyone through the portion of the quest that requires Rocket Launcher defeats. We weren\u2019t able to deploy a change to this step, but we can complete it for anyone who hasn\u2019t already done so. This gives us time to consider changing or removing this step for next Season.\n\n\n##\n\n***\n\nGuardians to the Rescue\n\n\nLast week, we pledged to support Australia\u2019s firefighting efforts and animal rescue and conservation efforts due to the ongoing bush fires devastating parts of the country. Today, we shared the full details on how you can support these efforts by purchasing a limited-edition \u201cGuardians for Australia\u201d T-shirt that also comes with a free \u201cStar Light, Start Bright\u201d emblem as a thank you for your donation.\u00a0\n\n\nThe shirt is now available for pre-order on the Bungie Store, and here is a quick preview of what it looks like.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/131/131582/BNG_for_australia_no_logo_16x9.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nm0DcG4.png)\n\n\n\n[\n\n](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48638)\n\n[Click here for the full details ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48638)on how you can add the shirt to your wardrobe and the new emblem to your collection.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patch Note Preview\n\n\nWhen the 2.7.0.2 update slipped, we were reminded that sometimes our plans have to shift a bit. But we were able to release it today with only a 48-hour delay! So far, 2.7.1 is on schedule and here\u2019s a small preview at a few of the changes coming in it.\n\n###Orbit/Director\n\n\n\n* Players can now shortcut directly to their Roster by selecting their empty fireteam slots, or by invoking the Roster shortcut on Director Map screens.\n* When an activity is selected, fireteam leaders can navigate left and right to get to Quests and Roster respectively, then back to their selected activity.\n\n###Weapons\n\n\n\n* Breakneck now has higher damage per second at Rampage x1 and x2, from 2170/2120 to 2190/2410.\n* The screen shake on Hard Light firing has been adjusted.\n\n###Armor\n\n\n\n* Several class item armor mods will now correctly provide diminishing returns when multiple copies of the mod are equipped. These mods include Perpetuation, Innervation, Invigoration, Insulation, and Absolution.\n* Grenade Launcher Scavenger will no longer award Special ammo for Grenade Launchers when the player picks up Primary ammo bricks.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##\u00a0SUPPORT RAPPORT\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130381/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lWv4HNA.gif)\n\n\n\nWe launched Season of Dawn last month and we scrambled the fighters to shoot down some new bugs this week. Player Support has the details.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###DESTINY 2 HOTFIX 2.7.0.2\n&gt;\n&gt;Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.7.0.2 was released to the world today, January 16, and resolved several known issues, including:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The **EDZ Obelisk** could sometimes not be accessed.\n&gt;* The **flashing notification icon** for Eververse did not stop flashing above Tess\u2019s head.\n&gt;* **Banshee-44\u2019s weekly bounty** was disabled and displays \u201cYou have already completed this\u201d.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The full patch notes are posted [here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48635).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###SOLAR SUBCLASS EMOTES\n&gt;\n&gt;Earlier this week, we identified an issue where the Solar Subclass Emotes were being sold for an incorrect price of 800 Silver on the Eververse Featured page. These Emotes were removed from the Featured page, but are still available for purchase at the correct price of 500 Silver on the Seasonal page.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We will follow up with affected players at a later date who purchased these emotes at the incorrect price.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###TRACKING KNOWN ISSUES\n&gt;\n&gt;Over the past few weeks, new issues have surfaced that our Player Support team has been tracking. Below is a list of the latest known issues that were reported in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Armor 2.0 **Transcendent Blessing mods** are not appearing in players\u2019 inventories.\n&gt;* Transitioning between areas in the **Pit of Heresy Dungeon** may result in unintentional character death. This will not prevent players from completing flawless dungeon runs.\n&gt;* The **Sundial Fractaline Extractor III** obtained from the Nessus obelisk incorrectly states an increased chance to find Polarized Fractaline when completing strikes. The enhancement actually increases the chance to find Polarized Fractaline when completing the Sundial and the Menagerie.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players should view our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179).\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As always, players encountering service issues should follow [@BungieHel](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp/)p on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help) for the latest info.

This is our chance to seek out our favorite community-created videos and literally force you to watch them here. Ok, maybe you don\u2019t have to watch them, but why wouldn\u2019t you? They\u2019re great!\n\n\n**Movie of the Week**:\u00a0 This is the Way\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/-AMCRItPFU8)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention**: Knives Out\u00a0\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/yMgkPkC4YwQ)\n\n\nThese auteurs just won a cool emblem as evidence of their filmmaking prowess. Please allow a few days for them to arrive. Thanks for using our game to express your creativity! It\u2019s just one of the reasons why we love this passionate community.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a light TWAB week. This new year is taking its time to roar back to full speed and the weather isn\u2019t helping at all. The current activity is hush-hush, so we\u2019re going to step back and watch as you work together to solve it.\n\n\nHappy hunting[.](http://i.imgur.com/v7TiY3J.jpg)\u00a0\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo**",

We\u2019ve entered our final week of the Dawning, so get to baking if you haven\u2019t already earned your Sparrows. You have through next Tuesday to complete as many double XP bounties as you can! Additionally, the Sundial has been kicked up a notch with a Legend difficulty. If you\u2019re looking to get the Savior title or round out your Pinnacle power drops each week, get your fireteam together and challenge these Psions in the ways of old.\n\n\nA new Exotic has also made its appearance, packing a little bit of Unstoppable heat, so to speak. Load up the Sundial and start your quest to acquire the Devil\u2019s Ruin Exotic Sidearm.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/AZnOdjIC5mc)\n\n\nWe\u2019re still warming up from our holiday hibernation, but we\u2019re hitting the ground running! This week, we have an update from our Game Security team, an announcement for a fundraiser to help send aid to Australia, and news on a hotfix coming early next week. Let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Keep it Clean\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/131/131506/Bungie_Security_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/YcWy6kD.gif)\n\n\n\nThe Game Security team has been improving *Destiny\u2019s* anti-cheat functionality which detects players violating any of [Bungie\u2019s restrictions and bans policies](https://www.bungie.net/bans). The anti-cheat improvements will result in more players receiving restrictions and bans.\u00a0\n\n\nHistorically, Bungie has not given players the ability to appeal a restriction or a ban because all restrictions and bans are already reviewed by a trained Bungie employee. However, going forward we will be providing a resource for players to appeal a restriction or ban. More details will be available on our Appeal Contact Form, which will be posted soon.\n\n\nIf you encounter any players suspected of cheating, please be sure to use the in-game reporting tool, as well as the [Report Suspected Cheating](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13967) contact form on [Help.Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help). Bungie will never issue a restriction or ban based purely on player reports, but player reports do help us corroborate other evidence.\u00a0\n\n\nFrivolous appeals will not be considered. Additionally, not all appeals are guaranteed to be responded to by a Bungie employee. As always, we\u2019ll be closely monitoring our security systems to ensure a healthy and fair experience for players who are not violating any of [Bungie\u2019s restrictions and bans policies](https://www.bungie.net/bans).\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Helping Australia: Star Light, Star Bright\n\n\nIn the last few weeks, you may have heard about the bush fires that are currently impacting Australia. With every Bungie Foundation effort, we are reminded of how much good can come from the gaming community. **Sr. Foundation Manager Christine Edwards** has details on our upcoming efforts to assist those in need, opening an avenue for Guardians around the world to lend a helping hand.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Christine:** Over the past two decades, the Bungie community has been an amazing force for good in our world by raising millions of dollars to assist those in distress. In addition to supporting thousands of children through our [iPads for Kids Program](https://bungiefoundation.org/ipadforkids/), you have helped victims of hurricanes [Katrina](http://halo.bungie.net/news/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;cid=6952)\u00a0and [Harvey](https://vocal.media/geeks/destiny-2-developer-bungie-teams-up-with-direct-relief-in-the-wake-of-hurricane-harvey)\u00a0and have donated to those affected by earthquakes in [Haiti](https://kotaku.com/bungie-seeks-halo-heroes-for-haiti-5449527#!), [Japan](http://halo.bungie.net/news/content.aspx?cid=30972), and [Nepal](https://www.directrelief.org/2015/06/bungie-rallies-50000-gamers-raises-1026006-80-for-nepal-earthquake-survivors/). Time and time again, you have been Guardians to others in their greatest time of need.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The bush fires currently ravaging Australia have been devastating. Many people have lost their homes, firefighters are risking their lives daily, and an estimated hundreds of millions of wild animals have fallen victim to the fires.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We are developing a limited-edition T-shirt fundraising campaign to support both Australia\u2019s firefighting efforts and the country\u2019s animal rescue and conservation efforts. The T-shirt, which comes with an exclusive *Destiny 2* \u201cStar Light, Star Bright\u201d emblem redemption code with purchase, will be available for pre-order on the Bungie Store and Bungie Store EU between Thursday, January 16 and Tuesday, February 18 at 9 a.m. Pacific, ending with the weekly reset and the end of Crimson Days. The team is currently hard at work on the T-shirt design and we\u2019ll share a preview early next week.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The first half of all profits generated by these T-shirt sales will be donated to [WIRES](https://www.wires.org.au/), Australia\u2019s largest wildlife rescue organization. The other half will be donated to [NSW Rural Fire Service](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/), which services the state of New South Wales, where the fires have been especially devastating and are in dire need of containment.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/131/131493/Aus-Emblem_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DLkmZRt.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Be sure to check out next week\u2019s edition of This Week at Bungie for more details on how you can support Australia through this fundraiser. In the meantime, our hearts go out to all that are impacted and we are wishing for clearer skies ahead.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Hammer Down\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130381/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/veR7q2f.gif)\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about Titans. You know, the ones that like to punch everything into oblivion. The class that sometimes throws their weapon aside in favor of a good ol\u2019 headbutt. This week, **Destiny Player Support**\u00a0has some vital information concerning a specific exotic that could amplify the damage of a throwing hammer to game-breaking values.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**WORMGOD CARESS DISABLED**\n&gt;\n&gt;Earlier this week, we identified an issue with the Wormgod Caress Exotic Gauntlets where the \u201cBurning Fists\u201d perk could retain increased melee damage after its intended timer countdown, allowing players to easily defeat raid bosses.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Armor 1.0 and 2.0 versions of these gauntlets have been disabled until a fix can be deployed at a later date.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**DESTINY 2 HOTFIX 2.7.0.2**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Tuesday, January 14, we will release Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.7.0.2. This hotfix will resolve a few known issues, including the EDZ Obelisk accessibility and Eververse waypoint notifications. Please see below for our rollout timeline.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **8 AM PST (1600 UTC):** Destiny 2 maintenance will begin.\n&gt;* **8:30 AM PST (1630 UTC):** Players will be removed from all Destiny 2 activities and will be unable to log in until 9 AM PST.\n&gt;* **9 AM PST (1700 UTC):** Players will be able to log in again and Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.7.0.2 will begin rolling out to all platforms and regions.\n&gt;* **12 PM PST (2000 UTC):** Destiny 2 maintenance is expected to conclude.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**TRACKING KNOWN ISSUES**\n&gt;\n&gt;Over the past few weeks, a few more issues have surfaced that our Player Support team has been tracking. Below is a list of the latest known issues that were reported in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The Leviathan's Breath Exotic Bow currently cannot be acquired due to an issue with 'The Arms Dealer' strike where it can only be completed in Season 8.\n&gt;* The Tower Obelisk can sometimes not be accessed. Players encountering this should return to orbit and launch back in to The Tower.\n&gt;* The Giddy Laugh emote keeps loading in the Emote Collection and can't be unequipped if slotted.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players should view our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**UNTIL NEXT DAWNING**\n&gt;\n&gt;As the holiday season comes to an end, so too does the Dawning. **The Dawning ends this coming Tuesday, January 14, at the [weekly reset](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46165)**. Players have until then to create their holiday gifts, upgrade their Dawning Sparrows, and earn double XP from Eva\u2019s bounties.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##That\u2019s a lot of Crucible\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129401/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/W2F9SrC.gif)\n\n\nThis week\u2019s winner features eight-minutes of pure Crucible carnage with a variety of weaponry, abilities, and straight up skill? Bows, throwing knives, Arc Beam, Hand Cannons, Sidearms\u2026 you name it. Legend of Acrius even snuck in for some love. Language warning for the final moments. Frostbolt, you\u2019d better wash your mouth out with soap!\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Mastery of Destiny**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/j03J81kp1yI)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Solo Flawless Pit of Heresy using Two Sidearms and a Sword.**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/5HhfQX019C4)\n\n\nCheers to each submission, as they\u2019ll both be taking home a Movie of the Week emblem. If you\u2019d like a chance for the emblem, submit your video to the [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nFirst TWAB of a new year. Prepare for things to ramp up here in the next few weeks. Season of Dawn still has more in store with an upcoming Exotic, Empyrean Foundation, Crimson Days and more.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130381/Destiny_SoD_Calendar_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TLQxuTe.jpg)\n\n\nBefore we go, we need to give some spotlight to [AGDQ2020](https://gamesdonequick.com/), otherwise known as **Awesome Games Done Quick**. For years, this speedrunning event has been yet another source of positivity within the gaming community, bringing people together in the fight against Cancer. Later today, the Last Wish speedrun will be [on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick) with commentary provided by a few familiar Destiny raid experts. The current time is projected to be around 7:30 PM Pacific, but things may change. Be sure to [check their schedule](https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule) for the most up to date information.\n\n\nHave a wonderful weekend, and we'll see you again next Monday.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": true, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1268587, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 1/9/2020", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/emho4d/this_week_at_bungie_192020/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "collections": [{"author_id": "t2_mocx5", "author_name": "DTG_Bot", "collection_id": "3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "created_at_utc": 1565530291.728, "description": "A list of all This Week At Bungie posts.", "display_layout": null, "last_update_utc": 1576800960.891, "link_ids": ["t3_af25cd", "t3_ah481q", "t3_ajsedl", "t3_alvfka", "t3_ao9wte", "t3_aqpxzn", "t3_at9ul5", "t3_avx91v", "t3_ayk8tz", "t3_b15gjp", "t3_b3wyr2", "t3_b6obl3", "t3_b9k4wk", "t3_bc5jkp", "t3_besokf", "t3_bhe8w9", "t3_bk1cnt", "t3_bmpymm", "t3_bpj5x6", "t3_bs9s8g", "t3_buzcp4", "t3_bxmngp", "t3_c0c9sb", "t3_c311of", "t3_c6bun6", "t3_cc0flf", "t3_cez1le", "t3_chufi1", "t3_ckuatg", "t3_cnreiv", "t3_cqwvcm", "t3_cu4h82", "t3_cx5ul9", "t3_d07vph", "t3_d3eovr", "t3_d6l8js", "t3_d9rjjg", "t3_dcy6rk", "t3_dg5pwn", "t3_djdrul", "t3_dmnqin", "t3_dptooj", "t3_dt5x25", "t3_dwhjnh", "t3_dzqtrz", "t3_e21qrm", "t3_e6oqhs", "t3_e9u6k8", "t3_ed20nj"], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/collection/3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "title": "This Week At Bungie"}], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576800960, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ed20nj/this_week_at_bungie_12192019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ed20nj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 765, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ed20nj/this_week_at_bungie_12192019/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1576800962, "score": 1, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48620\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we\u2019re closing out 2019\n\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a year. While we continued to build Destiny 2, we began the journey to publish it as well. Since then, we\u2019ve invited Guardians to master the Menagerie in Season of Opulence. We returned to the Moon to reunite with a familiar friend and confront new Nightmares. We repelled a Vex invasion and set off a chain of events that are currently being discovered by Guardians in Season of Dawn. With the passing of each Season, Destiny 2 has evolved.\n\n\nOn top of all that, we welcomed new Guardians to Destiny 2 and unified the community across all platforms with Cross Save. None of this would have been possible without you\u2014thanks for sticking with us throughout the years. It\u2019s hard to believe we find ourselves in the fifth year of Destiny. We\u2019re celebrating the end of this amazing year with The Dawning, which kicked off this week.\u00a0\n\n\nEva is back with her new Holiday Oven as well as new recipes and treats to deliver across the solar system. Perhaps you\u2019ll even want to gift some to an old nemesis. Be sure to grab some Dawning Bounties; they reward both Bright Dust and Double XP! Check out this [introduction to The Dawning](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/seasons/events/thedawning) for more info on what to expect during the event.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Dawn of Iron\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/131/131223/Iron_Banner_Dawn.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tMlh2OJ.jpg)\n\n\nNext week, Lord Saladin will hold the first Iron Banner of Season of Dawn.\u00a0\n\n\n**Iron Banner and Valor Bonus**\n\n**Start: 9 a.m. PDT on December 24**\n\n**End: 9 a.m. PDT on December 31**\n\n\nThere will be an Armor 2.0 version of the Iron Truage set available this season. The Seasonal Pursuit to earn this armor will work similar to last Season but we have changed some of the steps and what weapons are required to gain progress.\u00a0\n\n\nIn case you are just joining us, here is a refresher of how it all works.\u00a0\n\n\n* There is a new Seasonal Pursuit which must be completed prior to being able to turn in tokens to purchase packages from Lord Saladin.\n\n\n   * This pursuit is character based and rewards a Season of Dawn armor set.\n   * Each step of the pursuit awards Iron Banner weapons or armor.\n   * Most of the objectives within the pursuit track progress at any point during Season of Dawn, even if you have not yet acquired the pursuit.\n* Until the Seasonal Pursuit has been completed, all rewards will be obtained from completing matches and bounties.\n\n\n   * All of the rewards will be weapons until the Seasonal Pursuit has been completed.\n   * There will be seven bounties offering Pinnacle rewards (970 Power Max,) but only four are available per event.\n\nIf you were paying close attention to the Season of Dawn calendar you may have noticed an Iron Banner-themed Bow. That image will also show up as director dialogue in the game when Iron Banner starts next week. We were hoping to have the new Iron Banner Bow available this Season, but it had to be pushed to Season 10. Sorry about the delay, but we wanted to call it out to avoid any confusion.\n\n\nWe also made a change to the An Arsenal of Tricks bounty. The ability final blow requirements has been reduced by half.\n\n\nPut on your most powerful gear and go control those zones!\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Breaking Dawn and Time\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130381/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4J1bls9.gif)\n\n\nWe launched Season of Dawn last week and we scrambled the fighters to shoot down some new bugs this week. Player Support has the details.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###**A Cold Front**\n&gt;\n&gt;Eva Levante is visiting the Tower once again and has brought The Dawning with her. All players can use her Holiday Oven to gather and combine materials to form gifts for vendors across the solar system. The Dawning began on December 17, 2019, and ends at the [weekly reset](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46165) on January 14, 2020.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information about The Dawning, including some handy hints on those recipes and materials, [please view our support guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46556).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###**Hotfix 2.7.0.1**\n&gt;\n&gt;This past Tuesday, [Hotfix 2.7.0.1](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48607) was released to the world and resolved several issues found at the launch of Season of Dawn, including:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Destiny 2 PC settings would not save after quitting the game.\n&gt;* Dynamo mods granted more Super energy than expected.\n&gt;* Launching Forsaken Baron adventures would cause a Honeydew error.\n&gt;* Resonate Stems, Escalation Protocol chests, and other impacted rewards wouldn\u2019t be granted.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Known Issues\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Our Player Support Team has been monitoring player reports in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help) to find the latest issues impacting gameplay. Below is a summary of the latest reported issues.\n&gt;* The **EDZ Obelisk** can sometimes not be accessed.\n&gt;* The **Green With Envy** and **Heart of the Dragon** quests sometimes don't update while playing and completing Gambit or Crucible matches, respectively.\u00a0\n&gt;* Players need to reach **Mythic Infamy rank** to progress the Gambit \"Green With Envy\" quest step, not Fabled.\n&gt;* Warlocks cannot **Blink jump** after switching weapons or canceling Sprint.\n&gt;* Players who **accept or complete a quest from Osiris** will need to back out of his menu entirely and interact with him again to continue picking up other quests. This must be repeated for every quest picked up.\n&gt;* A **flashing notification icon** appears constantly above Tess\u2019 head in the Tower.\n&gt;* For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players should view our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).

Osiris calls upon you to combat the remnants of the Red Legion and prevent them from creating an alternate reality where they are victorious. Guardians are swarming Mercury and the Sundial in an effort to fix time itself. Obelisks revealed themselves on Mars and the Tangled Shore, bringing new Bounties to complete for sweet loot.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130790/Tangled_Web.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LrpX2Nt.jpg)\n\n\nWe are two days into the new Season with much more on the horizon. A legend needs saving, and additional obelisks will become available on alternate destinations next week.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130790/ag_season9_calendar_16x9_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/QVaApKA.jpg)\n\n\nNot only is this a change in Seasons, but an opportunity for your arsenal to evolve. New Exotic Catalysts are in the wild, granting benefits to a few Exotics you know and love. New Legendary weapons have been introduced, some packing new perks to give you an edge in combat. Keep an eye out for **Vorpal Weapon**, granting you additional damage against bosses, vehicles, and Guardians with their Super active. We\u2019ve already had a few players ask if the Boss Spec weapon mod stacks, to which we say\u2026 go find out!\n\n\nThree new Exotics have also been introduced to *Destiny 2* for owners of *Shadowkeep*.\n\n\n**Hunter: The Bombardiers**\n\nParting Gift: Dodging leaves behind an explosive that detonates after a short delay, damaging enemies around it.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130804/Hunter_Exotic_Legs.mp4)\n\n\n**Warlock: Promethium Spur**\n\nEmbers of Light: While Daybreak is active, defeating combatants or Guardians creates a Healing and Empowering Rift at their location.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130805/Warlock_Exotic_Legs.mp4)\n\n\n**Titan: Severance Enclosure**\n\nSpheromatik Trigger: Defeating a Guardian with a melee attack or a combatant with a finisher unleashes a damaging explosion.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130803/Titan_Exotic_Chest.mp4)\n\n\nWe\u2019ll be watching as you earn your loot, perfect your loadouts, and dominate your enemies in combat. Think you\u2019ve created a good build? Sound off on Twitter and you might find a retweet from [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Dawn of the Dawning\n\n\nAlong with the cold weather, Eva Levante is returning to the Tower. The Dawning is all about keeping warm though, as you\u2019ll be asked to bake cookies for your favorite (and less than favorite) vendors in our solar system.\n\n\n**The Dawning**\n\n**Begins: 9:00 AM Pacific on 12/17/2019**\n\n**Ends: 9:00 AM Pacific on 1/14/2020**\n\n\nAll of Eva\u2019s ingredients and cookies return from last year\u2019s event. We also added new ingredients and recipes and made some improvements to the baking process. For each batch of cookies delivered, you\u2019ll gain progress towards bounties and rewards for some Seasonal cheer.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130790/tower.eva_web.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kGF6BUD.jpg)\n\n\nThis year, Eva has a new SMG for you to bake: the **Cold Front**. Additionally, if you missed out on the perfect roll for the Machine Gun\u00a0**Avalanche** last year, it\u2019s your time to shine. Both weapons will be available to earn throughout the entire event.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130790/ColdFront_16_9.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fovJ6dN.jpg)\n\n\nWeekly and repeatable Dawning bounties also grant Bright dust, giving you more sources of this currency for new items on the Eververse storefront.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130790/Dawning_Eververse.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DqKB16K.jpg)\n\n\nOne item will be Silver only: The Perfect Ten finisher.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130802/Ice_Skating_Finisher.mp4)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##In Case You Missed It\n\nDid you find yourself in a mad dash to finish your Season of the Undying Triumphs and forget to pick up a few of your Season track rewards? We have good news! We created a new portal on the Seasons page that grants access to your Season Pass rewards track. Any items you earned will be available to claim, even if a season has ended.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130790/Rewards.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/j5o65ed.jpg)\n\n\nSteps for success:\n\n\n\n* Ensure you have available in-game inventory space, and at least 10 slots available at your postmaster\n* Sign in to **Bungie.ne**t, or sign in to the **Destiny Companion App**\n* Head to [https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/PreviousSeason](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/PreviousSeason)\n* Select your platform and character\n* Pick up any items that you\u2019re missing\n* Repeat for any alternate characters that may have missed their items\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##A New Dawn\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130381/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xXhsCVL.gif)\n\n\n\nA funny thing happened on the way to Dawn. With the added functionality of mod stacking in Armor 2.0, players were quick to find an interesting combination that could fully recharge a super in a single dodge. Player Support was quickly on the case.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;This week, Season of Dawn went live following Tuesday\u2019s deployment of [*Destiny 2* Update 2.7.0](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48556). Players looking for this Season\u2019s official support resource need to look no further than our brand new [Season of Dawn Support landing page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48528).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;From this page, players can learn how to get started with this new Season, as well as find out vital information and known issues relevant to Season of Dawn.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Holiday Treats**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next week, The Dawning returns for all players in *Destiny 2*. Just like Festival of the Lost, [New Light](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46180) players will need to ensure they meet the following requirements before they can participate in The Dawning festivities:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Escape the Cosmodrome to unlock The Tower.\n* Achieve 770 Power.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Once The Dawning is live, players should look to our [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help) support landing page for our official *Destiny 2* Dawning Guide. Until then, players can learn more about The Dawning by visiting our [event page](https://bungie.net/7/en/seasons/events/thedawning).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;***Destiny 2* Season of Dawn Known Issues**\n&gt;\n&gt;With the launch of this new Season, our Player Support Team continues their ongoing efforts in monitoring player reports in search of the latest gameplay-impacting issues. For the running tally, players should always look to our active [Known Issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/254628234) thread.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Here are some key items following this week\u2019s launch:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Some PC settings will reset when players close and reopen the *Destiny 2* client. Settings which have been confirmed to be impacted include: Window Mode, Resolution, Vsync, Framerate Cap, Anti-Aliasing Mode, and the key-binding for forward movement.\n* Resonant Stems are not providing Override Frequencies when consumed.\n* Some Forsaken activities cannot be accessed \u2013 and result in HONEYDEW errors when launched.\n* Dynamo mods have been temporarily disabled to mitigate an issue where they recharged Super energy abnormally quickly.\n* The Sunbreaker Titan Bundle has been temporarily removed from Eververse since it was not being discounted for players who already owned some ornament pieces.\n* Players who accept or complete a quest from Osiris will need to back out of his menu entirely and interact with him again to continue picking up other quests. This must be repeated for every quest picked up.\n* Players may not be able to progress the Sundial activity if the player who started the encounter dies before their allies join them. Players can work around this issue by quitting the activity or logging out and relaunching *Destiny 2*.\n* The Season of Dawn seal for the \"Savior\" title incorrectly lists a requirement of 28 Triumphs completed to unlock. The seal will unlock after completing the 15 Triumphs listed in the seal contents.\n* The Season 9: Challenges Triumph does not progress when a weekly challenge is completed.\n* The Season 9: Rituals Triumph does not progress when weekly Gambit bounties or Infamy ranks are earned.\n* The Season 9: Engagement Triumph does not progress when motes are banked.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As always, players encountering service issues should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp/) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help) for the latest info. Players encountering other issues are encouraged to report them to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Can we Just Call it a Tie?\n\n\nTwo creations were brought to my attention this week, both of which could win a \u201cMovie of the Week\u201d with no issue\u2026 if they were released on different weeks. We had studio-wide conversations over who should be given the winning title. It was a pretty tight call, but there can only be one.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Moon\u2019s Haunted**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/2VdMMesLfJM)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Awaken**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/QKu4alY0bmQ)\n\n\nCheers to each submission, as they\u2019ll both be taking home a Movie of the Week emblem. If you\u2019d like a chance for the emblem, submit your video to the [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThis is your second to last TWAB of the year. Holidays are on approach, and the blog will be taking a short hibernation as we ring in the New Year. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll still have many people in-house, making sure things are running smoothly and ensuring you won\u2019t encounter any unexpected issues while baking your Dawning cookies. Network Operations, Player Support, Community, and more will be at the ready to lend a helping hand.\n\n\nSee you again next week. It's almost time to *get that bread*.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/130/130806/GEt_that_Bread.mp4)\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false,

It\u2019s Tuesday, it\u2019s 10 in the morning, and we might have caught you off guard. This Thursday, we\u2019re celebrating Thanksgiving in the states. It\u2019s a day meant for us to reflect what we\u2019re thankful for while spending time with friends and family.\n\n\nWe couldn\u2019t leave for holiday without mentioning what we\u2019re all incredibly thankful for: you.\n\nGuardians like you inspire us every day, from the stories you\u2019ve shared about the friendships you\u2019ve made, to the tales of how you earned your favorite loot. Thank you to everyone who stopped by to share their stories over not only the last few weeks, but years of *Destiny* and *Destiny 2*.\u00a0\n\n\nThank you, dear reader, for being a Guardian.\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s get on to the news of the week. We have some community spotlight on a few artists, and info on our Black Friday sale, which just kicked off!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##But Before We Start\u2026\n\nSeason of Dawn begins December 10, 2019. We have a bit to talk about between now and then\u2026\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129912/D2_Season_of_dawn_Reveal_Stream.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/33g4mqO.jpg)\n\n\nJoin us on Wednesday December 4, at 10:00 a.m. PT for the reveal of a new season. Dawn is almost upon us.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Holiday Shopping\n\n\nThanksgiving dinner is the last thing between you and the Holiday season. [Black Friday at Bungie Store begins November 28, at 9 p.m. PT](https://bungiestore.com/). We have new gear including T-shirts, collectibles, and accessories that make the perfect holiday gifts for the Guardians in your life!

The program is currently by invite only and we plan on adding more designs soon.\n\n\nThe first wave of Community Artist Series merchandise will be available for pre-order on November 28, 2019 at 9:00 p.m. PT.\n\n\n**Sergey Parshakov: Vermillion**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129912/Seryozha_Parsha.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hBQkswy.jpg)\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\nHi, this is Seryozha (you can read it if you've read Zhalo in D1).\u00a0\n\nA Void Warlock who draws boring, mostly monochrome, pics.\n\n\n\nMy love for *Destiny* is based on two things:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- An awesome mix of fantasy and sci-fi.\u00a0\n\n- Use of Swiss graphic design traditions &amp; attention to in-game branding (Hakke!).\n\n\n\nI'm always searching for details which not everyone notices. I can watch at wall texture for tens of minutes, or how light draws Shrieker's shape. This inspires me.\n\n\nI'm convinced that the observing, analyzing &amp; mixing of opposite elements to create something new are the keys to an awesome result.\n\n\n**Brian Moncus: The Last**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129912/Brain_M_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/V1EeFWB.jpg)\n\n\nHi, my name is Brian Moncus or MrMoncus to some that know me by my social handles. I\u2019m a part time freelance artist and I\u2019ve been creating scribbles since I was a little kid with notebook paper and a No. 2 pencil.\u00a0 Currently I work digitally in Procreate on the Ipad Pro with a much more indirect approach to painting. Most of my work carries a darker vibe to it with influence from traditional charcoal work to iconic classical illustrations from artists such as Frank Frazetta. I love the *Destiny* universe and the stories within it, so I\u2019m constantly finding inspiration for new works.\n\n\n**Ian Pestridge: Triarchy**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129912/Petsy_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XDpQNm2.jpg)\n\n\nAfter studying Visual Art at University, I now work in the games industry as an Art Director. My inspirations are diverse but notable are Iain McCaig, Katsuhiro Otomo &amp; Gustave Dore. Stylistically my work is tonal, I utilise colour sparingly and purposefully. Detailed work with etch-like hatching and texture along with lighting, composition and mood are key to my style. I create art that excites and challenges me in style and subject, something visually arresting. My art allows me to express my enjoyment of *Destiny*; my favourite aspect is how creative and supportive the community and devs are.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Holiday Helpers\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129717/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bDie0FP.gif)\n\n\n\nEven through the holiday, we keep tabs on our services to make sure things keep running. Our Player Support Team will be lively in the forums, leaving no stone unturned as we continue to investigate issues in the live game.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Google Stadia and Chrome Extensions**\n&gt;\n&gt;Last week, *Destiny 2: The Collection launched* on Google Stadia. Since launch, we\u2019ve been closely monitoring reports for player-impacting issues on our local [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help). This week, we\u2019d like to highlight an issue which can emerge when players have Chrome extensions enabled while playing Stadia in their Chrome browser.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In some cases, Stadia players have reported that Chrome extensions can interfere with keyboard inputs during *Destiny 2* gameplay. If, for example, a player has a Chrome extension which uses the \u201cR\u201d key as a hotkey, the \u201cR\u201d key may be unresponsive during gameplay.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In all cases, we recommend that players remain aware of which Chrome extensions they have enabled, and be prepared to disable them in the event that they interfere with gameplay inputs. Alternatively, players can choose to rebind their keyboard inputs in their *Destiny 2* Settings menu. If players encounter other general issues with their keybindings, they should restore them to their defaults and set them again.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information on Google Stadia, players should visit our [Stadia Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48359).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Holiday Support**\n&gt;\n&gt;This Thursday and Friday, Bungie will be closed in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. Rest assured, our Bungie Network Operations Center will remain staffed to monitor services across *Destiny 1*, *Destiny 2*, and the *Destiny* Companion app.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In the event of a service interruption, players can receive the latest news by following [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp/) on Twitter or monitoring our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Cornucopia\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129401/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8jFoV9t.gif)\n\n\n\nFeast your eyes on this smorgasbord of artisanal treats, stuffed with the finest content our [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) has to offer. Look, I get that this intro went a little overboard on food references. It\u2019s almost Thanksgiving and all I can think about is Turkey. Deal with it.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Optimal Damage per Second**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/rExwgT4Fw9w)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Thin Line**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/5xp3_LzDukY)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Undying YEET**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/2wxR1ERQMh4)\n\n*Editors note: Yes, we see you throwing bosses off of the map. This is an example their revenge.*\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Wait for it\u2026**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/0LmYbdJfYe4)\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking for a new emblem to sport, and you think you have some footage worthy of Movie of the Week. Submit your video to our [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations), and maybe you\u2019ll take home the prize next week.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a light week, but we\u2019ll be back in just over a week with the reveal of Season of Dawn. We\u2019ll also have a patch note preview for *Destiny 2* Update 2.7.0, bringing a few quality of life changes to the fold. I\u2019m looking at you, Escalation Protocol armor.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n-Dmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1203352, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 11/26/2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/e21qrm/this_week_at_bungie_11262019/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "collections": [{"author_id": "t2_mocx5", "author_name": "DTG_Bot", "collection_id": "3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "created_at_utc": 1565530291.728, "description": "A list of all This Week At Bungie posts.", "display_layout": null, "last_update_utc": 1574373779.616, "link_ids": ["t3_af25cd", "t3_ah481q", "t3_ajsedl", "t3_alvfka", "t3_ao9wte", "t3_aqpxzn", "t3_at9ul5", "t3_avx91v", "t3_ayk8tz", "t3_b15gjp", "t3_b3wyr2", "t3_b6obl3", "t3_b9k4wk", "t3_bc5jkp", "t3_besokf", "t3_bhe8w9", "t3_bk1cnt", "t3_bmpymm", "t3_bpj5x6", "t3_bs9s8g", "t3_buzcp4", "t3_bxmngp", "t3_c0c9sb", "t3_c311of", "t3_c6bun6", "t3_cc0flf", "t3_cez1le", "t3_chufi1", "t3_ckuatg", "t3_cnreiv", "t3_cqwvcm", "t3_cu4h82", "t3_cx5ul9", "t3_d07vph", "t3_d3eovr", "t3_d6l8js", "t3_d9rjjg", "t3_dcy6rk", "t3_dg5pwn", "t3_djdrul", "t3_dmnqin", "t3_dptooj", "t3_dt5x25", "t3_dwhjnh", "t3_dzqtrz"], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/collection/3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "title": "This Week At Bungie"}], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574373779, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dzqtrz/this_week_at_bungie_11212019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dzqtrz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2573, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dzqtrz/this_week_at_bungie_11212019/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1574373780, "score": 1, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48462\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we\u2019re investing in solar energy.\u00a0\n\n\nWe wrapped up Festival of the Lost this week, but cleaning up the decorations wasn\u2019t the only thing that changed in the Tower. Ikora finished her construction project, closed out all the permits, and Guardians launched an attack on the Undying Mind.\n\n\nThe attack is ongoing and all Season Pass holders can join in on Vex Offensive and transmat the finished portal from the Tower to summon and defeat Undying Minds from different timelines.\u00a0\n\n\nThe impact of your victory has not been made clear just yet, but in time, you will learn more about how this will further evolve the world as we transition into the next Season.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Solar Shifts\n\nNext Season, we are shaking up the Solar subclasses. We are reworking several ability trees and the **Destiny Dev Team** has the details on what to expect when you praise the Sun next season.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: Hey Guardians, it\u2019s the Combat Systems team here, back again to talk about some updates we\u2019re making to the abilities sandbox in the next Season. Previously we spent a Season focusing on subclasses of one specific element type such as Arc and Void. Up next, the Combat Systems team is tackling Solar subclasses as our focus for gameplay updates.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As we\u2019ve mentioned in past TWABs, our goal with these subclass updates is to \u201crevisit some older subclass paths and freshen them up a bit.\u201d In execution, this means that older subclass paths will feel like viable choices in many of our activities and that players can find a home in any of them.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When we started working on sandbox updates to follow Season of the Undying, our team looked at the whole catalog of Solar subclasses by cross referencing data, feedback, and conversation to figure out which subclasses needed help, which are performing fine, and which ones were a bit too potent. During our investigations, it was pretty clear that three specific subclasses were underperforming and needed to be taken back into the shop for a rework.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s worth noting here that a rework doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a completely new subclass. It means that we took the root of the gameplay fantasies for those subclasses and either expanded on what was already there or shifted some of the existing attributes closer to their fantasy. In some cases, entire perks were changed to help further the gameplay role and fantasy of those subclasses.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Those three Solar subclasses are:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Gunslinger: Way of the Sharpshooter (Bottom Path)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129717/Subclass_Hunter_Solar.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9ZGgTp3.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Traditionally, Way of the Sharpshooter has mostly been used in specific PvE activities and almost exclusively paired with the Celestial Nighthawk helm. We wanted to move Way of the Sharpshooter to be something players want to choose more often and for a wider range of activities. To do that we needed to differentiate both Golden Gun paths and make Sharpshooter more versatile and interesting to use in PvE. In order to differentiate the 3-shot and 6-shot Golden Gun and better play into their fantasies, we've made the following changes:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For **3-shot we increased the auto-aim distance and reliability when aiming down sights**, as it fulfills the role of long range accuracy. For **6-shot, we shortened the damage falloff range** to emphasize the short range gunfighter role with a lot of kill potential. While it can still perform at longer ranges, it may take an extra shot to get the job done. We've made other changes to Way of the Outlaw to help keep its potency like adding a new **Explosive Prox Knife that can stick to surfaces and detonate when enemies pass nearby.**\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;All up - we want Way of the Sharpshooter to feel more active and rewarding for players who can fulfill the role of the sharpshooter by taking down enemies with accuracy and precision.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;***NEW* Weighted Knife**: High-damage knife throw with a long wind up. Travels at high speeds, bounces once, and does extra damage to the head. Precision shot final blows recharge the melee completely. **One-hit precision final blow in PvP.**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Practice Makes Perfect**: (QoL):\u00a0 Lasts longer but gives a bit less energy per second. Precision hits grant two stacks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;***NEW* Knock 'em Down**: Precision final blows increase weapon stability and ADS speed. Timer starts at 10 seconds but any additional final blow/assists can increase it up to 25 seconds. Casting your Super with this buff above 20 seconds consumes the buff and grants extra damage. (Does not stack with Celestial Nighthawk).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Line 'em Up**: (QoL): Old perks from Crowd Pleaser are now part of this perk. (Golden Gun can cause precision damage and precision shots generate orbs of light).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Sunbreaker: Code of the Devastator (Middle Path)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129717/Subclass_Titan_Solar.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pPKw6OD.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Titans who adhere to the Code of the Devastator want nothing more than to crush their foes with smoldering hammers, and we want to see them live their dreams. When our data indicated that this subclass was underperforming in PvP, we decided to make a few changes that should enable it to be more competitive.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The **Roaring Flame perk has received a significant buff** to its bonus damage, and the buff now lasts 25% longer, making it easier to build and retain stacks between encounters. The **base damage of Throwing Hammer melee ability has increased**\u2014it's now very lethal in PvP while you have Roaring Flames active. In addition, once you've thrown the hammer and it\u2019s lying on the ground, you don't have to get quite as close to it to pick it back up. Finally, we tuned the Super in a number of ways.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For starters, **Burning Maul now lasts longer**, giving you more time to use it strategically instead of simply spamming the slam button. *(Titans. All we want to do is smash, right?)* We also **increased the height of the heavy-slam explosion**, so this Super should feel much more potent against airborne enemies. That's the gist of it, but here are more details:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Throwing Hammer**: Increased impact damage from 100 to 120 and increased hammer pick-up radius from 2m to 3.5m. Adjusted hammer throw animations to fit a more damaging attack.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Roaring Flames**: Increased damage bonus from 10% per stack to 25% per stack in PvP, and increased duration from 15 seconds to 20 seconds.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Burning Maul**: Increased duration from 21.2 seconds to 28.5 seconds\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Light Attack**: Reduced light attack energy cost from 5% to 3%. Adjusted the animation so that it flows seamlessly into chained light attacks without stopping.\n&gt;* **Heavy Attack**: Ground Slam attack now detonates when it detects enemies above it. Detonation radius was increased to make landing attacks more consistent. Increased energy cost from 6% to 8%.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Dawnblade: Attunement of Sky (Top Path)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129717/Subclass_Warlock_Solar.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LPUDoZX.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With Attunement of Sky we wanted to push its air superiority gameplay further. When we initially released this path, its movement capabilities were tuned around the original Destiny 2 gameplay experience, which was much slower and more deliberate about positioning. However, over time, this movement needed to adapt to the new sandbox. We want to give you the gameplay experience that the fantasy begs for: A flying angel who can maneuver with grace and destroy its foes below.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Now before we get started I wanted to touch on one thing: To accomplish our goals of reworking the air superiority role, we needed to differentiate the two Daybreak paths from one another. As such, we **reduced the speed at which Burst Glide accelerates players in Daybreak**. We know this is a controversial change but we wanted to reserve the air superiority gameplay with Attunement of Sky and the Burst Glide speed was blurring the lines between both Daybreak paths.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Icarus Dashes while in Daybreak have increased speed and thrust to recapture the burst glide gameplay** for those running the air superiority path. We hope that, while this change is different, you still feel as fast as before\u2014but with maybe a bit more expression behind that speed. The rest of the changes are below:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;***NEW* Celestial Fire** (Melee): Send a spiral of three explosive Solar projectiles.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Heat Rises**: (Rework) Consume your grenade to extend Glide time and dramatically reduce the in-air accuracy penalties for weapons.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Winged Sun** (Rework): Fire weapons, use Celestial Fire, and throw grenade while gliding. Airborne final blows grant melee energy and extend the duration of Heat Rises.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Icarus Dash** (Rework): Tap (Crouch) twice to dodge in midair. Dodging in Daybreak accelerates players farther and costs less Super energy while under the effects of Heat Rises.\n&gt;\n&gt;*Added note: Due to the nature of these reworks, Wings of Sacred Dawn received a buff where it gains 15% damage resistance while Tome of Dawn is active.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There are a whole swath of changes we\u2019re working on that extend beyond these three subclasses. Most Solar subclasses had some tuning and some non-Solar subclasses got a bit QoL love too. We hope that with these changes, you\u2019ll feel energized playing any Solar subclass\u2014regardless of activity. Thanks for having us!\n\n\n##\n\n***\n\nFinal Howl\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/128/128534/Iron_Banner_v460.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lax03pr.jpg)\n\n\nNext week, Lord Saladin will return to the Tower for the final time during Season of Undying. This will be your final shot at earning pinnacle rewards from Iron Banner until next Season. If you haven\u2019t finished up your Season Pursuit, make sure to do it before the end of the event on December 3.\n\n\n**Iron Banner Control**\n\n**Starts: 9:00 a.m. PT on November 26**\n\n**Ends: 9:00 a.m. PT on December 3**\n\n\nWe\u2019ll be featuring a reprised armor set next season, so if you still want to get some pieces from this set, grab them quick! Saladin is also offering enhanced mods and other items in exchange for Iron Banner tokens you may have collected. You can turn them in now or bank them for when Iron Banner returns next Season.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Gaming and Giving\n\nWe\u2019re completely blown away by the generosity you all showed throughout the Game2Give fundraising campaign in support of the Bungie Foundation\u2019s iPads for Kids Program and of Children\u2019s Miracle Network Hospitals.\u00a0\n\n\nIn just three weeks, you all raised $1,673,857.62! We reached this incredible amount of funding because of the 40,000+ donors and 5,500 streamers who supported the campaign across 104 countries. To say this was a true global Guardian initiative is an understatement!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129717/Bungie_Foundation.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qIfZE45.jpg)\n\n\nFor the Bungie Foundation, this will give us the capacity to expand into up to five new hospitals in 2020 and help over 250,000 more patients than we ever have before! We are so excited to continue our work of replacing fear with joy, boredom with entertainment, and uncertainty with a sense of normalcy for so many more kiddos.\n\nAnd check out how this funding will help the work that Children\u2019s Miracle Network Hospitals does every day.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129717/Info.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OWiYbMY.png)\n\n\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, thank you for showing us once again how truly special the Bungie Community is through caring about each other and those in need.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Wanna Cook?\n\n\nFor those looking to add more Destiny books to their collection, we are very happy to announce ***Destiny: The Official Cookbook*** and ***Destiny Grimoire Anthology Vol. Three*** are coming in 2020.\n\n\n**[Destiny: The Official Cookbook](https://bungiestore.com/collections/art-books/products/coming-soon-destiny-the-official-cookbook)**\n\nIn collaboration with Insight Editions and author Victoria Rosenthal, *Destiny\u2019s* first official cookbook is filled with recipes inspired by the characters and locations seen throughout its expansive universe.\n\n\n**[Destiny Grimoire Anthology Vol. Three](https://bungiestore.com/collections/art-books/products/coming-soon-destiny-grimoire-anthology-volume-iii)**\n\n*Destiny Grimoire Anthology Vol*. *Three* is coming in late 2020 as the next edition of the popular Grimoire series.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129717/Grimiore_CookBook.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uYSsGPR.jpg)\n\n\nThese titles will be available at the Bungie Store and other booksellers. Stay tuned for more details.

Players who are looking to get set up with Stadia for the very first time should make sure they visit our [Stadia Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48359).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Furthermore, existing *Destiny 2* players who wish to bring their characters over from other platforms can do so right now through our Cross Save page. As a refresher; [Cross Save](https://www.bungie.net/crosssave) allows players to access their preferred set of Guardians, gear, and Season Passes on all (Stadia details below) platforms.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;New players who are starting their *Destiny 2* journey with Stadia can also enable Cross Save, so the Guardians they build and gear they earn travels with them to other platforms. However, players should know that Season Pass access granted on Stadia through *Destiny 2: The Collection* **does not** transfer to other platforms using Cross Save.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;*Destiny 2: The Collection* on Stadia includes a Season Pass access at no additional charge. Players who have Cross Save enabled with their Stadia account who would like to access Seasonal content on other platforms (PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam) will need to purchase those Season Passes directly on one of those platforms.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As a final reminder, expansion licenses (*Forsaken, Shadowkeep*) do not transfer between platforms with Cross Save. Players who wish to access activities which rely on these expansion licenses will need to purchase them for every desired platform.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###PC Migration and *Forsaken* Licenses\n&gt;\n&gt;Since *Destiny* 2 launched on Steam last month, we\u2019ve monitored posts from players who have provided feedback and reported issues regarding the PC Migration experience.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;After thorough investigation, we believe that we have resolved an issue which was preventing a subset of PC players from transferring their *Forsaken* licenses from their Battle.net accounts to Steam. Players who previously encountered this issue should re-initiate migration at our [PC Move](https://www.bungie.net/PCMove) page.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;*Destiny 2* Known Issues\n&gt;\n&gt;Listed below are emergent issues being investigated in *Destiny 2*.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The MIDA Multi-Tool catalyst will not drop for players who win a competitive Crucible match at the Legend rank if they are playing with clan mates and the \"Catalyst Seeker\" clan rank bonus is active. To mitigate this, we recommend that players seeking the catalyst play solo or team up with friends who are not in the same clan.\n&gt;* Black Armory Keys cannot be used or deleted if the Mysterious Box quest has already been completed.\n&gt;* Some players may experience an issue where blank items from Festival of the Lost are taking up slots at their Postmaster.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the latest list of emergent issues, players should visit our [Known Issues thread](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253725678). Players who observe other issues should report them to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Act III\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129401/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HGHOzbl.gif)\n\n\n\nGather around and check out some of our favorite community created videos this week.

Today, some of those fixes were deployed.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###*Destiny* *2* Hotfix 2.6.1.1\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Earlier today, we deployed [Hotfix 2.6.1.1](http://bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48420) that targets a pair of emergent issues which prevented players from opening the Mysterious Box and acquiring [Izanagi\u2019s Burden](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/3211806999). Here are some highlights of other changes also included in the hotfix:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Fixed an issue causing Forge Keys to not count towards Mysterious Box (Izanagi's Burden) quest progression.\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Players affected by this should find the corresponding objective marked correctly after logging in.\n&gt;* Fixed an issue where the Obsidian Crystal would not give quest progression.\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Players affected by this will need to reacquire a Black Armory Rare bounty and then complete and claim it to get another Obsidian Crystal.\n&gt;* Fixed an issue that occasionally caused the weekly Eris Challenge to not drop a powerful reward.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In addition to this week\u2019s hotfix, today we deployed a server-side change that allows players to receive the Black Armory Key Mold on all of their *Destiny 2* characters. This resolves an issue where the Black Armory Key Mold could only be accepted by the first character that claimed it from Ada-1.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For information on upcoming maintenance windows, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp/) on Twitter or monitor our support feed at [help.bungie.net.](https://www.bungie.net/en/help) For our patch notes archive, players should visit our [Updates](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Index?tag=news-updates) page.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###REMINDER: Daily and Weekly Reset Time Change\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For Guardians who observe it; Daylight Saving Time has concluded for 2019.

We have a full menu of activities to tackle, challenges to master, and Exotic loot to add to your collection.\u00a0\n\n\nFestival of the Lost is about to return. We have a [full preview of the festivities](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48357) Guardians can look forward to next week. The Moon isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s haunted. The Haunted Forrest will be back, and the Tower will be spookier than ever.\u00a0\n\n\nA new dungeon is also opening up to willing fireteams or brave Guardians who want to tackle it alone. Speak with Eris; she knows the way.\n\n\nThe Crucible is about to gain some momentum as well, changing the way Guardians meet in glorious combat.\n\n\nEarlier this week, Banshee sent Season Pass owners out on a quest to claim the Leviathan\u2019s Breath Exotic Bow. If you haven\u2019t completed the quest yet, check this out.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm7ecYOsfIY)\n\n\nOn top of all that, there\u2019s another Exotic quest going live for Shadowkeep owners. You may have seen [pictures of a replica](https://twitter.com/AurumEffects/status/1149001083030609920) we had made of the \u201cbug gun\u201d from past events. It\u2019s time for you to go out and claim the Xenophage as your own.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/Xenophage.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/04xqnZL.jpg)\n\n\nWhere will your path take you first? There will be many options for you to consider, depending on how you like to play the most.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Continue the Momentum\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/Momentum_Header.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zU8T19r.jpg)\n\n\nNext week, Lord Shaxx is mixing things up in the Crucible with a new mode called Momentum Control. While Mayhem puts focus on Supers, Momentum shifts your focus to gunplay. This is a fast-paced, hair-on-fire experience where the lethality of all weapons has been cranked to 11. You\u2019re incentivized to be aggressive as you defeat other Guardians to earn charged melees, grenades, and Supers. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of what to expect:\n\n\n* Instant Respawn Times\u00a0\n\n\n   * Out of the fight? No problem; drop right back in immediately\n* Weapon Damage Increased\u00a0\n\n\n   * Higher combat lethality\u00a0\n   * *Everything* in your arsenal is a contender\n* Ability Regen Requires Effort\u00a0\n\n\n   * Defeat enemy players to charge your melee, grenade, and Super\n* No Tracker\u00a0\n\n\n   * Sneak around your enemies for some sweet flanks\n* Amped Control\u00a0\n\n\n   * Zones capture faster and grant more bonus points per kill\n* Super Charged Supers\n\n\n   * Increased damage resist in Super means you become the 1,000-pound gorilla\n   * Be careful, because Heavy weapons will put you down quickly\n* The Heaviest of Ammo\u00a0\n\n\n   * Increased Heavy ammo respawn rates and drop amounts\u00a0\n\n\nMany of us who have been playtesting this have compared it to the classic Halo custom game SWAT, but for Destiny. We\u2019ve done a lot of trying out different weapons and seeing how they behaved in this heavily modified sandbox of a mode.\u00a0\n\n\nMomentum will be the featured 6v6 rotating playlist during Festival of the Lost. We\u2019ll be monitoring the community\u2019s response to see when we want to bring it back.\u00a0\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing your feedback.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Triumphant\n\nNow that we\u2019re neck deep in Season of the Undying, we wanted to talk about some changes to Seasonal Triumphs in the third year of *Destiny 2*. You may have noticed some of the changes to the system and the *Destiny* Dev Team wanted to let you know some of our thinking behind why we are adjusting Triumphs going forward.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Destiny Dev Team:\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;As always, we start with the goals:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Provide more tiers of pursuit for players\u00a0\n&gt;* Provide Seasonal pursuits that match each Season of Destiny\n&gt;* Ensure everyone has a chance to show off their accomplishments\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###What\u2019s in a Triumph Tier?\n&gt;\n&gt;Starting with *Shadowkeep*, individual Triumphs can now have tiers. They grant a portion of its total Triumph score as you make progress toward the final Triumph. For example, consider the SEASON 8: POWER BONUS Triumph. It has three tiers. To earn the first tier, you need to gain 5 points of bonus Power from your Season 8 Artifact, the Gate Lord\u2019s Eye. Once you do, you\u2019ll get 10 points of Triumph score toward your account\u2019s total Triumph Score, and the next tier will be revealed to you.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As part of this release, we went through all the existing Triumphs in the game and added in tiers to Triumphs where they made sense.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###A Title to Match the Season\n&gt;\n&gt;This is probably too much homework, but the \u201cAn Evolving World\u201d section of Luke\u2019s [Director\u2019s Cut\u2014Part III](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48072) is essential reading. The CliffsNotes version as it pertains to titles? Okay, we\u2019ll try. Prior to Season of the Undying, each piece of the Annual Pass added parts of the game designed to live on forever. During Season 8, a new situation will unfold on the Moon. Over the course of the Season, the situation will be resolved and some of the related activities will go away as Season 9\u2019s conflict arrives.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This will also be true of the Title associated with Season 8. Both the Triumphs and Badge for the new title will ask players to be participate during the [Season of the Undying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8mC5GaDoyQ). Once the conflict has been resolved players will no longer be able to earn the season\u2019s title, Undying.\n&gt;\n&gt;###New Light and Getting ALL the Score\n&gt;\n&gt;New Light forced us to think about many of the existing Triumphs and evolve our philosophies around what Triumph Score represents. For example, when a New Light player joins the game, should they receive all the score for getting to level 50 without having to put in any effort? That doesn\u2019t feel like much of a Triumph. That said, shouldn\u2019t a new kinderguardian have a chance to have the magical moment where they hit [max score](https://twitter.com/lulusoccer/status/1161726261011668992?s=20)? Also, our evolving world will lead to many Triumphs that will no longer be able to be earned. Yet, we\u2019ve heard loud and clear that Triumphs without score aren\u2019t very compelling. The rules had to evolve.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The decisions!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Pre-*Shadowkeep* Triumphs that no longer require effort can\u2019t be earned after Season 7.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * These Triumphs have had their score reduced to 0.\n&gt;   * The players who have earned them will still see them in their Triumphs.\n&gt;* Seasonal Triumphs will have a score value. If you miss Triumphs during Season of the Undying, you may not be able to max out your score for the year.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;Even with an evolution to our Triumph philosophy, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re done making tweaks to the system. Not everything is as clean as we\u2019d like it to be in order to support Destiny as an evolving world. We\u2019ll be listening closely for feedback as we consider how to best continue the evolution of Triumphs.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Color Your Words\n\n\nAccessibility is something we\u2019re always trying to improve in *Destiny*. We have some new changes coming next week to make subtitles easier to read. The *Destiny* Dev Team is here to tell you more!\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: Have you ever found yourself wishing the subtitles were bigger, or liked having them on but thought they took up too much space, or wanted them to be a different color?\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It has always been important for us that we make Destiny\u2019s UI accessible to the widest range of possible players as we can. Later this month, we\u2019ll be releasing an update that adds more options to let you change the look of subtitles in Destiny. Five different sizes to pick from, a variety of text colors, and a few different styles for the background.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129052/twab_subtitle_options_downres.mp4 )\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;These new subtitle settings are found in the settings tab under \u201cGameplay\u201d on PC and \u201cAccessibility\u201d on consoles, and they\u2019re present in new users\u2019 initial log-in experience. We\u2019ve also taken this opportunity to consolidate some PC settings into five subsections.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This is just one focused update on increasing accessibility options in Destiny, with plans for additional updates in later releases. (A small example that didn\u2019t quite make this next release is a fix for subtitles disappearing when navigating between menus). We\u2019d love to hear your feedback on these changes, as well as what other accessibility improvements are important to you.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Ready for the Runway\n\nLast week, we put out the call for all fashion-focused Guardians to put on their best threads for Fashion Week. We have an esteemed panel of judges who have been searching through the submissions to settle on a few favorites to honor as the first Fashion Week winners. Here are picks for each class!\n\n\n###Hunters\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/HunterFashion1_Worg_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RYsBsYy.jpg)\n\n\n\nWorg\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/HunterFashion2_Waidelotte_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tTyvtf3.jpg)\n\n\n\nWaidelotte\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/HunterFashion3_Narhzul_2.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KkeuCH6.jpg)\n\n\n\nNarhzul\n\n\n###Warlocks\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/FashionWarlock1_Morrigh4n_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XpRGmf5.jpg)\n\n\n\nMorrigh4n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/FashionWarlock2_Danni_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sD1NBkc.jpg)\n\n\n\nDanni\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/FashionWarlock3_Themergingwheati_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BBDsCxj.jpg)\n\n\n\nTheMergingWheat\n\n\n###Titans\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/FashionTitan1_TadsJr_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IlS9clq.jpg)\n\n\n\nTadsJr\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/FashionTitan2_AFatalChick_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/39pvgwK.jpg)\n\n\n\nAFatalChick\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/FashionTitan3_Crissis_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oAFm1y0.jpg)\n\n\n\nCrissis\n\n\nOther Guardians also caught our eye. Fashion is subjective, and though this Guardian\u2019s look may be considered \u201cunconventional,\u201d they wore it loud and proud. Here is our honorable mention.\n\n\n###Honorable Mentions\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/Fashion_HonorableMention_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Gxqfmp4.jpg)\n\n\n\nAngel Montero\n\n\nAll of the Guardians mentioned will receive a special emblem as a badge of honor. If you would like to be featured here and claim that emblem as your own, keep an eye out for the next Fashion Week in a future TWAB for how to submit.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Forges and Festivals\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pwWDmVh.gif)\n\n\nPlayer Support has everything you need to know for next week\u2019s update.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Destiny 2 Update 2.6.1\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Tuesday, Destiny 2 Update 2.6.1 is scheduled to go live. This update will introduce a broad variety of changes to the player experience, and resolves a number of known issues that have emerged since the launch of Shadowkeep. Here are some highlights:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Resolved an issue that prevented some veteran players from unlocking Black Armory forges and completing the Mysterious Box quest for Izanagi\u2019s Burden.\n&gt;* Resolved an issue that prevented players from abandoning the Mysterious Box quest for Izanagi\u2019s Burden on alt characters\u2014it will be retrievable from Ada-1.\n&gt;* Resolved an issue where the Exodus Black destination quest could not be recovered if abandoned\u2014it will be retrievable from Failsafe.\n&gt;* Resolved an issue which prevented some players from earning the \u201cSilimar\u2019s Design\u201d Triumph\u2014this Triumph will unlock retroactively for eligible players.\n&gt;* Resolved an issue causing daily bounties from Eris Morn and the Lectern of Enchantment to rotate weekly.\n&gt;* Resolved an issue that increased load times for previewing gear while traveling between destinations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, we\u2019d like to remind players that we\u2019ve resolved an issue causing crashes in the Gofannon Forge in [Hotfix 2.6.0.4](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48298). Players who previously encountered issues engaging with Black Armory content are highly encouraged to try again once Update 2.6.1 becomes available next Tuesday.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As with all updates and hotfixes, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help) for the latest details as soon as they are available.\n&gt;\n&gt;##Festival of the Lost\n&gt;\n&gt;Also next Tuesday, Festival of the Lost returns to Destiny 2. In case you missed it in our [blog ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48357)earlier this week, we encourage all players to take a look at our official [Festival of the Lost Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/47296).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Before Eva Levante returns to adorn the Tower in ghoulish decor, we\u2019d like to inform players of what they can do *right now* to prepare for the festival\u2019s return.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Brand-new players who go through the New Light experience must achieve at least 770 Power before Eva Levante will beckon them with her Festival of the Lost introductory quest. If these players are lower than 770 Power, they will not be able to interact with Eva Levante at all.\n&gt;* All veteran players, including those who were boosted to 750 Power at the launches of New Light and Shadowkeep, may head directly to Eva Levante once Festival is live to begin her quest.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While New Light players must achieve 770 Power before they can jump in, the Haunted Forest has a minimum recommended Power of 750\u2014so all Guardians should be ready to jump right in.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, while we await the festival\u2019s return, we\u2019d like to forewarn players about earning and deleting Candy and Chocolate Strange Coins. In order to earn these currencies, players must wear the Masquerader\u2019s Helmet, purchasable from Eva Levante for 100 Glimmer. If players defeat enemies and complete activities without this helmet equipped, they will not earn Candy or Chocolate Strange Coins.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Furthermore, players should be cautious when dismantling any items in their Consumables inventory. Any instance of dismantling Candy or Chocolate Strange Coins, intentional or otherwise, will delete the entire stack.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who encounter issues following the launches of Update 2.6.1 and Festival of the Lost should report them to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##New Movies\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/X8eAThg.gif)\n\n\nEvery week, we\u2019re on the lookout for community-created videos. We take our favorites and feature them here for all to see, and the winners receive a special emblem. In fact, starting this week, we have a new emblem for all future MOTW winners.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129051/MTOW_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/5nCu6SK.jpg)\n\n\nLooks good right?

The Iron Banner is up and running and we have some new things lined up for next week. Master Nightmare hunts begin next week. These will be the most difficult Nightmare hunts to date, so equip your best weapons and gear.\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s not all. The Exotic Quest for Leviathan\u2019s Breath will also go live for all season pass owners. Rumor has it that Banshee knows something about where to start.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##The Show Must Go On\n\nThe infamous Hunter known as Paul \u201cThe Big Show\u201d White is stopping by our studio this weekend. He\u2019s going to join us on stream to play some Destiny. That means that some of you will have a chance to win an Emblem. This will be a Bungie Bounty, but we are going to mix up the activities. We\u2019ll play a few Strikes, some Vex Offensive, and then finish up with some Crucible so Big Show can pound some Warlocks into dust.\n\n\nThe usual rules for a Bungie Bounty apply: For Crucible, you will need to match into our game and be on the winning team. For everything PVE, you only need to match with us fight the good fight to earn the new Bungie Bounty emblem.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/128/128861/Bountry_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/L5yMiel.jpg)\n\n\nThe last time we did a Bungie Bounty we played on Xbox.

More on that later\u2026\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Shifting Sands\n\nWe have a few tweaks coming to the combat sandbox in update 2.6.1, which is currently being targeted to deploy on October 29. Here is the **Destiny Dev Team** to give you the details.\u00a0\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Super Energy Refunding Kills\n&gt;\n&gt;**Goals:**\n&gt;\n&gt;For a while now, Trample and Everlasting Flames have been an outlier, especially in PvP. We\u2019ve previously done a pass to add diminishing returns to this but it\u2019s proven to not be enough. In this update, we\u2019ve tightened the curve a bit and split it out over PvE and PvP. This should allow Guardians to keep dunking on combatants for longer while being less oppressive against one another.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, for Striker, we\u2019ve increased the cost of the light attack to make dashing across the map a little less forgiving. We still want this to be used as a way to run people down or dodge and be shifty, but this change should make it costly enough as to be prohibitive as a form of long distance travel. Finally, regeneration will no longer proc on melee kills while in super. The combination was just too strong and overly forgiving of strategic or positional mistakes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Striker - Code of the Juggernaut (Bottom Path)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Trample:**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Tuned the amount of Super energy returned per kill\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * Reduced amount returned possible per kill from 15% to 13% (before diminishing returns)\n&gt;      * Reduced the low end of the diminishing returns from 5% to 3.25%\n&gt;      * Changed the kills for the diminishing returns by splitting them out between players and combatants\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         * Previously it was 15 kills. Now it is 14 combatant kills or 7 player kills (players count for 2X towards diminishing returns)\n&gt;   * Cost of light attack in super increased by 50% from 2% to 3%\n&gt;   * Regeneration on kill no longer procs on super kills\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dawnblade - Attunement of Flame (Bottom Path)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Everlasting Flames:\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Tuned the amount of Super energy returned per kill (handled differently than Striker as this attack in an AoE)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * Increased the low end of the diminishing returns from 0.75% to 0.95%\n&gt;      * Changed the kills for the diminishing returns by splitting them out between players and combatants\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         * Previously it was 30 kills. Now it is 21 combatant kills or 7 player kills (players count for 3X towards diminishing returns)\n&gt;\n&gt;###Quality of Life and Bug Fixes:\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sentinel - Code of the Protector (Top Path)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Ward of Dawn:**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Armor of Light timer now correlates with the life of the Ward of Dawn\n&gt;   * Particle FX move more rapidly towards the end of the Ward of Dawn's life\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Nightstalker - Way of the Wraith (Middle Path)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Shattering Strike:\u00a0**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Fixed a bug in which Shattering Strike activation window was reduced to 3 seconds along with Truesight\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * Shattering strike last the proper 9 seconds once again\n&gt;\n&gt;**Shoulder Charge**\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019ve removed a bug that allowed players to shoot immediately before activating shoulder charge, which allowed players to apply the 1-2 Punch damage buff to shoulder charge. This bug was caused by a quality of life change made for Tempest Strike. Before Shadowkeep, if player's had the sprint button configured as \"hold to sprint\", then they would need to be holding the sprint button while sliding in order to activate Tempest Strike. With the release of Shadowkeep, we added a small window of time where players could activate Tempest Strike after letting go of the sprint button. This change had unexpected effects on other melee abilities, so we have reverted this change until we can find a better fix for Tempest Strike.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\nWe\u2019re also aware of feedback about other abilities and gear not mentioned above. We have our eye on One Eyed Mask \u2013 expect a change in a future update.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patch Note Preview\n\nAlong with the sandbox changes we already mentioned, we have a preview of some of the other patch notes coming up in update 2.6.1:\n\n\n\n* Forsaken subclasses will display the correct super icon in the PvP HUD for the following Subclasses:\n\n\n   * Thundercrash\n   * Burning Maul\n   * Blade Barrage\n   * Spectral Blades\n   * Nova Warp\n   * Well of Radiance\n   * Chaos Reach\n* Fixed a bug where Warlocks who wagered Weak Motes in Reckoning were incorrectly being rewarded Titan gear\n* Fixed a bug that increased loading times for gear preview while in space flight.\u00a0\n* Players should notice their character models update more quickly while changing gear, previewing ornaments, or previewing shaders during space flight\n* Phantasmal Core stack cap raised from 3 to 999\n\n**Steam**\n\n\n\n* Blocking Communication with Players in Steam will now block/mute Players in Destiny 2\n* Added Functionality for /addfriend and /removefriend commands\n\n\n   * /addfriend [ PlayerName ]\n   * /removefriend [ PlayerName ]\n   * Note - Players must be in one of your Rosters (Fireteam, Friends, or Clan) in order to Add/Remove them as a Friend\n* Added Functionality for /invite command\n\n\n   * /invite [ PlayerName ]\n\n\n      * Note - Players must be in one of your Rosters (Fireteam, Friends, or Clan) in order to Invite them by PlayerName\n   * /invite [ SteamID ]\n\n\n      * Note - You can Invite Players by SteamID, regardless of if they're in your Roster or not\n* Players can now /invite and /join another Player regardless of their Steam Online Status ('Online', 'Invisible' or 'Offline')\n* /help description updated to reflect new changes to commands\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Fully Operational Art Station\n\nAs you immerse yourself in the world of Destiny, there is a lot of beauty to take in. The environments, the characters, the weapons, every little detail is lovingly crafted by talented artists who help bring this game to life. We wanted to showcase some items they have helped work on and give you some links to see more of their work below.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image

We have been monitoring the feedback around the system. Today, the **Destiny Dev Team** has some goals for Armor 2.0 and some upcoming changes that are coming.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi everyone! We wanted to check in and talk a little about Armor 2.0, its goals, your reactions, and upcoming additions and tweaks to the system.\n&gt;\n&gt;The most frequent questions and feedback come from the energy affinity system, which determines which mods can be socketed into which armor pieces. We wanted to kick this discussion off with a little bit more information on the reasons why the energy system came about, and what it\u2019s intended to accomplish. The armor energy system has the three following primary goals:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**1. Give players the freedom to experiment with builds, while also requiring players to make creative choices when putting together those builds.** The biggest reason why mods became unlocks instead of consumables is to encourage players to experiment with perk combinations. The energy type and cost of a mod asks players to consider which mods they value most for a particular build, sometimes requiring them to make choices or come up with creative combinations of armor energies across all five equipped armor pieces.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**2. Give players the ability to balance mods above and beyond pure effectiveness.** When mods have no restrictions on their use (as was the case prior to Armor 2.0), each mod is only evaluated on its strength and usefulness (or access, in the case of consumables). Giving mods an energy cost gives us a knob to turn that gives weaker mods value and stronger mods a drawback. Giving mods an energy type allows us to limit the scope of combinations within a single armor piece (making their use cases easier to predict and balance for), and also gives us room for other perks and mods (for example, artifact mods) that break these restrictions. This means the perks and mods that break the rules can be compelling choices, without them having to also be significantly stronger to be appealing.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**3. Relieve information overload pressure on the mod UI.** Early playtests, which did not have the energy system, had all mods for a particular slot visible each time you moved your cursor over them. This resulted in a huge amount of information overload, and also made it hard to quickly find, and change out, mods that you were seeking. Cutting down on the number of mods visible for a particular armor piece makes it easier to process this information.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There\u2019s a lot more to it than that, but those are the most notable points.\n&gt;\n&gt;When it comes to deciding which weapons were associated with which affinity, there were three main criteria used to choose where to put them:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;1. Ammo Type: Each energy type needed to have a good mix of primary, special, and power ammo weapons.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;2. Range: Each energy type needed to have a good mix of short, middle, and long-range weapons.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;3. Thematics: Each energy type should have weapons that are similar thematically, when possible, and feel like the kinds of weapons that match other mechanics associated with that energy type.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We have seen feedback suggesting that, instead of locking mods into an energy type, the affinity should simply be a discount on the energy cost of the mod. That\u2019s actually what the broad-category mods (such as Rifle Loader, Precision Weapon Targeting, etc.) are meant to represent: a higher cost for gaining the benefit with a weapon not normally associated with that energy type. So, instead of having to display every mod for that slot when you move your cursor over the socket, you see only the two to three broad-category mods in that socket, plus the ones with energy types associated with it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, not every mod type got a broad-category version, notably the mod types that affect the ammo economy. That\u2019s because any mods that tinker with the ammo economy have a lot of caveats and exceptions, mostly due to weapons that use ammo types not normally associated with that weapon archetype, such as Eriana\u2019s Vow, the Mountaintop, Whisper of the Worm, and so forth.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We needed a bit more time to build the broad category versions of these mods and test them thoroughly, but at the start of next season there will be broad-category mods for both the ammo finder and ammo scavenger categories, and they will be automatically unlocked for all players (no need to hunt them down!). This should help round out your builds more easily, and give you more options for tinkering with your ammo no matter what armor energy type you use. We\u2019re also working on some broad category ammo capacity mods, but those need some more work before they\u2019re ready for primetime.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Another big change coming up is the loosening of stacking restrictions on Armor 2.0 mods. Starting next season, the restrictions on having multiple mods of the same type in a single piece of armor will be removed (with a few exceptions). So, you\u2019ll be able to run two Hand Cannon Loader mods, or two Shotgun Ammo Finder mods, and so forth. The only exceptions to this stacking come from mods that provide no benefit when stacked, such as Fastball and Traction. We needed a little more time to make sure that stacking mods wouldn\u2019t cause any major technical issues, and think that stacking mods of the same type gives more flexibility in crafting your build, provided you have the armor energy to spend in socketing them in.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;One thing to be aware of with mod stacking: In most cases, stacking up identical mods will provide diminishing returns on their effectiveness. For example, two Hand Cannon Loader mods don\u2019t provide twice the benefit; instead, they provide about 1.5x the benefit of one Hand Cannon Loader mod. However, this puts them on equal footing with the enhanced mods. So, two Hand Cannon Loader mods provide the equivalent benefit of a single Enhanced Hand Cannon Loader. We\u2019re also going to be lowering the energy costs of some of the armor mods to better reflect the value of an enhanced mod.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;One last bit of news on Armor 2.0. When we created the system, we wanted to include armor mods in Collections, so you can see how many you have gathered, and where they can be acquired. This also presented a good opportunity to do some housekeeping on the Collections tab in general, but, unfortunately, proved to be a little more time-intensive than we\u2019d hoped, so the changes didn\u2019t come alongside Shadowkeep. Good news, though! In the 2.6.1 patch, coming later this month, armor mods will be visible in your Collections, allowing you to browse through all the possibilities and see which ones you have already collected. Additionally, starting next season, the armor mod Collections will get a UI upgrade, allowing them to display armor energy type and cost on the icon, just like they do in your armor socket.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Fashion Week\n\n\nIt\u2019s fashion week. In a previous update we showed you The Levante Prize, a fancy new emblem we will be giving out to fashion-focused Guardians.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126430/Fashion_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ufBnosb.jpg)\n\n\nDo you think you have an eye for style? Submit a picture of your best dressed Guardian on Bungie.net or in a reply to our Fashion Week tweet. We will choose our favorites and feature them in next week\u2019s TWAB. Please include a link to your Bungie.net profile with your submission to help us out with granting your emblem if you win.\n\n\nSince fashion is never finished, we will plan on doing this regularly, hopefully once a month.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Cyber Sleuths\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uuNGbHu.gif)\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been tracking bugs and already deployed a few fixes since Shadowkeep launched earlier this month. Player Support has the latest.\n\n\nThis is their report.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.6.0.4\n&gt;\n&gt;This week, we deployed [Destiny 2 Hotfix 2.6.0.4](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48298) to players on all platforms. This hotfix resolved several issues to emerge in the player experience since launch. Here are some highlights:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Fixed an issue where the Servitor spawning in the Gofannon Forge could crash the game.\n&gt;* Fixed an issue where Nightmare Hunts Time Trial Master triumph would not progress correctly.\n&gt;* Fixed an issue where Nightfall: The Ordeal would not drop a powerful reward for players who had already completed the Vanguard Strikes Challenge.\n&gt;* Fixed an issue that provoked the temporary deactivation of rally banners and the \u201cTire Game\u201d in the Sanctuary vendor space on the Moon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As with all updates and hotfixes, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help) for the latest details as soon as they are available.\n&gt;\n&gt;###PC Migration\n&gt;\n&gt;Since launch, we\u2019ve been investigating player reports regarding a subset of issues which may cause PC Migration to fail for PC players importing their accounts from Battle.net.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While investigations are ongoing, we\u2019ve deployed several fixes to Bungie.net over the past two weeks which are expected to resolve a number of issues encountered by players. If your account has failed to migrate, to include the transfer of characters, Silver, and/or licenses, we encourage you to [try again](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove). As a reminder, once PC Migration has been initiated, it cannot be undone.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Aside from issues being investigated in the migration process, we\u2019ve also observed reports from players who\u2019ve linked the wrong Battle.net or Steam accounts to their Bungie.net profile, resulting in migration either to or from an undesired account.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who linked and migrated from a different Battle.net account than desired can perform migration again. To do so, players must link their intended Battle.net account to a new Steam account through Bungie.net and perform a new migration.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who link and migrate to a different Steam account than desired must log in to that account on Steam in order to access their characters, Silver, and licenses. Once migration is initiated, these **cannot** be transferred to another Steam account.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players encountering process issues with PC Migration may opt to assist us in our efforts to aggregate information. Player who wish to do so should submit a response to our [contact form](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=48284). Please note that this form is designed to gather information about PC Move issues, and that each ticket may not receive a personalized response.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As a final note, we\u2019ve also observed confusion from players believing that their *Forsaken* licenses did not transfer from Battle.net to Steam, because the *Forsaken* campaign was not available from Amanda Holiday. Unlike the *Red War, Curse of Osiris*, and *Warmind* campaigns included in New Light, which are received from Amanda Holiday in the Tower Hangar, the Forsaken campaign begins with players launching directly into the first mission from the Tangled Shore destination map.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Destiny 2 Known Issues\n&gt;\n&gt;Destiny Player Support monitors player reports on our local [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help) and tallies the latest issues into our [Known Issues thread](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253725678). Listed below is a selection of recent issues that have been reported by players:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* The Black Armory Key Mold cannot be obtained by players who did not receive it before Season 8.\n&gt;* Players who have the \"Invitation from the Emperor\" and \"Golden Hero\" quests on multiple characters can't unlock the Tribute Hall.\n&gt;* Warlocks wagering Weak Motes in Reckoning are receiving Titan armor.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As always, players who encounter issues are encouraged to report them to our #Help forum.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Prime Time\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LT9rMBN.gif)\n\nIt\u2019s time for Movie of the Week. This is where we pick a few of our favorite community videos of the week and share them out for all to see. The winners will receive a special emblem.

Guardians must confront familiar foes from their past along with powerful Champions who will become more challenging over the next few weeks as the additional difficulties unlock. Keep a look out as new Nightmares emerge for the Legend and Master hunts.\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only event that started up this week. The Vex didn\u2019t take too kindly to us venturing into the Black Garden. They have begun their own invasion and can be found mobilizing on the Moon. Fight off the Vex in our new six-player activity, the Vex Offensive. It\u2019s available now for all Season Pass owners.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Too Heavy\n\nEarlier this week, we issued a server-side change to reduce the amount of Heavy ammo spawning in the Crucible. The change affected Control, Clash, and Supremacy. We also have Heavy ammo changes planned for 3v3 Survival in a future update. You can read the [full details here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253859859?sort=0&amp;page=0).\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only quick reaction we made to the Crucible environment this week. We also issued a server-side change that affected matchmaking in 3v3 Survival. You can read about the [change here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253895105).\u00a0\n\n\nExperimentation with the 3v3 Elimination game mode is ongoing in the Crucible Labs. The first settings we deployed saw Heavy ammo spawning 90 seconds into every round. Revive tokens were also enabled. There was a bug causing Heavy ammo to spawn in instantly, but we were able to get that fixed with a server change. This week, these settings were slightly adjusted. Instead of receiving revive tokens, players can revive as many times as they are able\u2014but the revive timer grows longer each time a player goes down.\n\n\nTwo additional configurations will be introduced in the weeks to come. Our plan is to gather feedback on what you like the best. If you played Elimination back in D1, next week\u2019s settings might be familiar to you.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Iron Banner\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/128/128534/Iron_Banner_v460.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SAACwZq.jpg)\n\n\nLord Saladin is about to make his first appearance in Season of the Undying. The great fires of the Iron Banner will burn again as Guardians face off against each other for bragging rights and new rewards.\n\n\n**Iron Banner and Valor Bonus**\n\n**Start: 10 AM PDT on October 15**\n\n**End: 10 AM PDT on October 22**\n\n\nThis season, willing combatants have a chance to earn the new Iron Will armor set. Here is a look at what you stand to gain in battle.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127113/V460_Armor_IB.mp4 )\n\n\nThe way you earn rewards in Iron Banner is changing this Season:\n\n\n\n* There is a new Seasonal pursuit, which must be completed prior to being able to turn in tokens to purchase packages from Lord Saladin\n\n\n   * This pursuit is character based and rewards the new S8 armor set\n   * Each step of the pursuit awards Iron Banner weapons or armor\n   * Most of the objectives within the pursuit track progress at any point during Season of the Undying, even if you have not yet acquired the pursuit\n* Until the Seasonal pursuit has been completed, all rewards will be obtained from completing matches and bounties\n\n\n   * All rewards are weapons until the Seasonal pursuit is complete\n   * The existing seven bounties that offered powerful rewards have been adjusted to offer pinnacle rewards (960 Power max,) but only four are available per event\n\n\n      * We are tracking a bug in which the four bounties offered as pinnacle rewards rotate each day allowing more than four to be completed during a single event\n\n\nBecause Iron Banner has its own version of Control, the Heavy ammo spawning changes we made early this week will not be reflected in this Iron Banner. We are planning to make this change in a future update before the next event.\u00a0\n\n\nNow go control those zones!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##First to Finish \n\nLast Saturday, the race began to complete \u201cGarden of Salvation,\u201d the newest *Destiny 2* raid. As is tradition, players prepared the best they could and waited at the starting line to see if they could rise above the rest and finish first. We watched on as fireteams fought their way through the mysterious Black Garden. Reaching the final boss was only the beginning, as several teams all stacked up and began to try to put the pieces together and be the first to take it down. In the end, [Clan Ascend emerged victorious](https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1180626468847570945), finishing an astonishing 2 minutes before the second team. We asked them to share a bit about their experience.\n\n\n**Congratulations on being World First for Garden of Salvation! Tell us a little about your clan.\u00a0**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Ascend**: Our clan was built with the intention of going hardcore on *Destiny 2*\u2019s raids! We were founded back in Forsaken, a month before \u201cScourge of the Past\u2019 was about to go live.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Since then, we have been doing speed runs, World First attempts, as well as low man and low Light challenges. Our ritual was to do a lot of the previous raids under leveled while making sure we focus on executing the mechanics as smoothly as possible! We have achieved a 4th spot on \u201cScourge of the Past,\u201d a 9th spot on \u201cCrown of Sorrow\u201d and now finally we have gotten our World First that we have been putting so much effort in together! The clan is trying to focus on a very small community that enjoys playing and interacting with each other so we can push each other further than we would have gotten before and ascend together to the top!\u00a0\n\n\n**Practice how you play. That\u2019s smart. What were some of your favorite moments during the raid?\u00a0**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Ascend**: First of all, the STUNNING scenery. Honestly, this raid is so beautiful! The tether mechanic was awesome, even though it got hectic at times. Figuring out encounters together as a team is always fun, and then executing them with as little deaths as possible is just always a great time!\u00a0\n\n\n**Anything else you would like to say as a team?\u00a0**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Ascend**: Thanks to everyone for stopping by and giving us some love after the clear! Thanks to all the big streamers that we look up to who came to spread the love. Thanks for all the compliments that we have gotten. It's honestly still unbelievable that we have achieved this\u2014especially because it was such a super close and intense race with Reality... And of course, thank you Bungie for making these races possible!\n\n\nCongratulations to Ascend on the World First victory. We also want to congratulate all of the teams who showed up make an attempt and all of the teams who have been able to clear the raid thus far.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Moon Platoon\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oR2wuNg.gif)\n\n\nNeed help getting the most out of your lunar excursions?

To resolve this, players will need to delete their affected character and create a new one.\n&gt;* The \u201cShow Me What You Got\u201d Achievement/Trophy can no longer be unlocked on characters created prior to *Shadowkeep*. This can only be unlocked by creating a new character and proceeding through the *New Light* experience.\n&gt;* The perks for Lunafaction Boots do not describe their updated functionality.\n&gt;* The \u201cScan Patrol\u201d Triumph won\u2019t gain progress if scans are completed in the Chasm area on the Moon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, investigations are ongoing for issues reported by players attempting to perform PC migration.

Here are the top issues at the time of this writing, straight from our [known issues thread](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253725678):\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players will not receive the Gate Lord\u2019s Eye at Season Rank 7 if they claim it in an equipment-locked activity.\n&gt;* If it has been abandoned, the completed \u201cEssence of Anguish\u201d quest step can be reacquired only by unlocking the Lectern of Enchantment.\n&gt;* The \u201cIn Search of Answers\u201d quest step may not appear in a player\u2019s inventory, even after talking with Eris. Please check the postmaster to pick up the quest and continue the campaign.\n&gt;* If the \u201cFirewall\u201d quest step is dismantled after completing Eris\u2019s weekly bounty, players have to wait a week before they can obtain a new one.\n&gt;* If the \u201cLuna\u2019s Calling\u201d weekly quest is deleted before collecting rewards and the bounty is reclaimed, players will have to wait a week to complete it.\n&gt;* Some players who purchase the Shadowkeep Deluxe Edition may not receive all four Season Passes, but may instead receive 1,000 Silver per unredeemed Season. Players may spend this Silver to purchase future seasons through the Seasons tab in the Director menu.\n&gt;* Players who encounter the error \u201cproblem reading game content\u201d on Steam should ensure that they are NOT running Destiny 2 with elevated permissions (for example: do not use \u201cRun as Administrator\u201d). They should also make sure there is NO steam_appid.txt file in their Destiny 2 install directory.\n&gt;* Players with 300 or more friends on Steam may encounter crashes when launching Destiny 2. Players who encounter this issue can trim their friends list until they are below 300 while we investigate a fix.\n&gt;* We\u2019re investigating ongoing reports from players regarding issues with PC migration. In the meantime, if possible, players should attempt to [retry migration](https://www.bungie.net/PCMove).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who encounter other issues not listed in our [known issues thread](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253725678) should report them to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Tapes\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kIy5hsa.gif)\n\n\nWhat is Movie of the Week?

Here are some more details on what to expect.\u00a0\n\n###PvE Damage Numbers Display\n\nGoal: To provide players with useful and legible feedback for damage dealt to enemy combatants across many years of Power progression.\n\n\n\n* Displayed damage numbers for damage dealt to non-Guardian enemy combatants are crunched\n\n\n   * Damage dealt is displayed using fewer digits to enhance readability of damage output\n   * Occurrences of displayed damage getting capped at 999,999 should be significantly reduced or eliminated\n   * The exponential curve used to calculate damage numbers for display is replaced with a new linear curve that is built to last for many years\n   * As players grow in Power, displayed damage numbers increase at a much more measured pace than previously\n   * **This is a UI update only; player damage output, whether measured as hits to kill, time to kill, or DPS, remains unchanged by this update**\n\n###**PvE Difficulty Tuning**\n\nGoals: Widen the sweet spot where fighting higher-level combatants provides a fun, challenging, and rewarding combat experience for a more enjoyable Power climb. Also, allow players looking for even greater challenges to confront much higher-level enemies.\n\n\n\n* Combatants that are 10\u201340 levels higher take less time to kill and deal less damage\n* Higher-level combatants continue to increase in difficulty up to 100 Power levels above the player\n* When enemies are 100 Power levels or higher above the player, they are immune to damage\n* Nameplate icons on higher-level combatants have been updated to reflect these changes\n* These changes affect only higher-level combatants; the at-level or over-level experience remains unchanged\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Progression and Economy Changes\n\nEvery Season brings with it some tweaks to the Power climb. Shadowkeep is going to deliver significant changes to how you grow in strength. We also want to make you aware of changes to various currencies and the [Eververse Trading Company](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47935) before you set out to power up your gear.\n\n###Rewards Power and Progression\n\n\n\n* All non-powerful rewards now drop 3 to 0 points below your highest equippable Power level, up from 15 to 20 below\n* Year 2 powerful reward sources have changed to Legendary rewards\n\n   * These sources no longer have a chance to drop a random Exotic instead of the Legendary gear\n* Bonus Exotics that drop from Nightfall: The Ordeal will drop at the character\u2019s highest equippable Power level\n* Under- and over-leveling activities no longer adjust how much Power is received from the rewards\n* Experience no longer fuels a player\u2019s character level, which has been changed to be level 50 for all characters\n\n\n   * Experience instead progresses the Season Pass, Seasonal Artifact mod, and Power progressions, as well as the unlocking of destinations for new characters\n   * Experience rewards have been rebalanced with the introduction of the Season Pass and Seasonal Artifact progressions\n* The Power granted from the Seasonal Artifact is additive with the Power of the player\u2019s equippable gear, but does not increase the Power of gear drops\n* All existing gear has had its Power increased to a minimum of 750; new characters will begin Destiny 2 at Power 750 as well\n* The Power bands for Season 8 are as follows\n\n   * Floor: 750\n   * Soft Cap: 900\n\n\n      * All drops up to this point will be upgrades to the most powerful item in your inventory or vault\n      * Beyond this point, only powerful and pinnacle rewards will increase a player\u2019s Power\n   * Powerful Cap: 950\n\n\n      * All non-powerful/pinnacle rewards are capped at 950\n      * Pinnacle rewards are the only way to raise Power above this point\n      * Powerful rewards are equivalent to the character\u2019s highest-equippable Power beyond this point\n   * Pinnacle Cap: 960\n\n\n      * This is the highest Power at which gear drops; also known as the \u201chard cap\u201d\n      * The Seasonal Artifact bonus Power allows characters to attain values above this level\n* Prime Engrams\n\n\n   * Prime Engrams now gain charges more quickly, drop more frequently, and have a higher maximum charge cap (nine charges, up from six during Year 2)\n   * The Power gains have been rebalanced for the increased frequency, providing +3 Power, down from a range of +4 to +7\n   * Players who have completed the \u201cPrime Example\u201d quest prior to Shadowkeep\u2019s release will earn charges, but those charges won\u2019t drop until the character has reached 900 Power\n   * This will help players avoid spending charges early for gains that are most beneficial during the Soft Cap to Powerful Cap range\n\n###Bright Dust\n\n\n\n* Bright Dust is now earned by completing Crucible, Gambit, and Vanguard weekly and repeatable bounties\n\n\n   * We chose to grant all of Bright Dust from ritual weekly bounties rather than spreading it out across the weekly and daily bounties so players could more easily earn Bright Dust without having to make sure they complete every single daily\n   * Players will be able to do the repeatable bounties as many times as they like\n   * Any Crucible, Gambit, or Vanguard completed bounties need to be turned in before maintenance begins on 9/30 as these changes will reset them; other bounties\u2014Gunsmith, clan, Eververse, etc.\u2014can still be claimed after Oct 1\n* Eververse items no longer dismantle into Bright Dust, and instead grant legendary shards and glimmer\n* New Eververse items for Season of the Undying will become available for Bright Dust two weeks into the Season\n* Eververse items no longer require Bright Dust to reacquire them(or re-roll perks) from Collections; instead, they cost the same materials that reward items of the same type/rarity use\n* Fireteam Medallions have been removed from the store, deprecated into Fizzled Fireteam Medallions, and can now be dismantled into Bright Dust to recover their purchase price (50 Bright Dust)\n* Gleaming Boon of the Vanguard price has been lowered to 150 Bright Dust\n* Gleaming Boon of the Crucible price has been lowered to 500 Bright Dust\n\n###Eververse\n\n\n\n* The Season 7 Best of Year One Engram has been retired, and in its place, players can now obtain the new Season 8 Nostalgic Engram\n* The Seasonal Milestone no longer grants a bounty; instead, it directly grants a Bright Engram\n* The Season 8 Nostalgic Engram is no longer earned at level up\n\n\n   * Instead, the Bright Engram is now included in the free rewards of the Season Pass that are visible before level 100; it\u2019s also awarded every 5 levels after level 100\n* The Eververse storefront is now available via the Director\n* Eververse bounties (standard and IGR versions) have been deprecated; any remaining bounty notes can be broken down into Bright Dust\n\n\n   * You can still complete and turn in any outstanding Eververse bounties until they expire\u00a0\n\n###Glimmer\n\n\n\n* Players can now store up to 250,000 Glimmer\n* Glimmer rewards from the majority of sources in the game have been rebalanced\n\n\n   * Most open world sources (public events, Lost Sectors, chests) have been significantly increased\n   * Passive Glimmer gain on kill has been reduced\n   * In addition to directly awarding Glimmer on kill, combatants will sometimes drop additional Glimmer chunks\n* Weekly bounties award a large amount of Glimmer in addition to their other rewards\n\n###Spider\u2019s Exchange\n\n\n\n* The Spider welcomes new opportunities with four arms open and now deals in materials from all planets\n* However, the Spider has noted changes in market value, and has adjusted his exchange rates accordingly:\n\n\n   * Glimmer exchange now costs 10 Legendary Shards or 20 materials, and yields 10,000 Glimmer\n   * Tangled Shore daily bounties no longer award Glimmer, providing instead Etheric Spirals (in keeping with his competition)\n   * Weekly wanted bounties no longer award gear, but now provide between 3,000 and 15,000 Glimmer in addition to the Enhancement Cores currently offered\n\n###X\u00fbr\n\n\n\n* X\u00fbr\u2019s inventory pool and Fated Engram now include world-drop Exotics from Year 2\n\n\n***\n\n\n##Patch Note Preview\n\nWe\u2019ll have a bunch of bullet points for you to peruse next week. Here\u2019s something to tide you over until then.\n\n\n* Added rally banners to Leviathan, Eater of Worlds, and Spire of Stars\u00a0\n\n\n* \u201cThe Shattered Throne\u201d Dungeon is now available at all times instead of on a three-week cycle\n\n\n   * It can also be launched and reset from the Director\n\n\n* Black Armory forges are now accessible through a Director-launched playlist on EDZ\n\n\n* Weapon mods are now treated as reusable unlocks instead of consumables; any mods you have in your inventory will be converted to unlocks\n\n\n   * If the only copy of a mod you have is already in a gun, you will need to reacquire one to unlock it\u00a0\n\n\n* Discarding an Enhancement Core no longer deletes the entire stack\n\n\n* Borealis and Hardlight now match the Prism modifier when changing elements on reload, rotating through Void, Arc, and Solar\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where the Hunter\u2019s Tempest Strike melee ability couldn\u2019t be performed if the sprint button/key was set to Hold\n\n\n* The Phoenix Protocol Hearth perk will no longer award bonus Super energy on kills and assists to Warlocks inside a Well of Radiance if they do not also have the Well of Radiance (Attunement of Grace) subclass equipped\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where allied Golden Gun projectiles weren\u2019t going through Banner Shields\n\n\n* Fixed an issue where the Queen\u2019s Wrath perk for the Exotic Wish-Ender Bow wasn\u2019t correctly highlighting players if their shield was depleted\n\n\n* Players who\u2019ve obtained the Salute emote in the past can now correctly select it in their collection and assign it to their emote wheel\n\n\n* Multiplayer (buddy) emotes will now have a visible indication of where a player can stand to interact and initiate the emote\n\n\n* Failing the first encounter for any Black Armory forge will no longer award planetary destination materials. \u0ca0_\u0ca0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Ritual Weapons and Perk Changes\n\nIn Season of the Undying, pinnacle weapons will become ritual weapons. They will no longer have special perks and will instead be curated rolls. A previous article incorrectly showed two new pinnacle weapons. The good news is you will be getting three ritual weapons for each of the ritual activities: Crucible, Vanguard, and Gambit. Here\u2019s the **Destiny Dev Team** on why we made this difficult decision and some information on upcoming perk changes.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: The decision to stop creating extremely powerful pinnacle weapons was made for a variety of reasons. The first was that the band in which \u201cpinnacle\u201d perk can exist is actually quite small, and most of them far exceeded the efficacy they should have been at. Another issue is that they cause problems in the player ecosystem, particularly in the case of the Crucible pinnacle weapons. Due to the nature of PvP and PvE, anything that works well in PvP is likely going be extremely effective in PvE as well. This forces players into the Crucible if they want the \u201cbest\u201d loadouts. Even the title of \u201cpinnacle\u201d set a variety of unrealistic expectations. Rather than being the absolute height of Legendary power, they were supposed to be interesting novelties to chase.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;These problems became more pronounced the more of them we produced. In the end, we decided to move away from pinnacle weapons. If you managed to collect them all, we hope you enjoy them!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we\u2019re on the subject of weapons, here are a few important notes on changes to how perks will work.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Reduced the effectiveness of the following perks in PvE:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Rampage, Kill Clip, Swashbuckler, Multikill Clip, Desperado, Surrounded, Master of Arms, Onslaught\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * In general, these perks use the same damage multipliers for PvE that they did in PvP\n&gt;   * The change to Rampage does not affect the Huckleberry\n&gt;   * Onslaught and Desperado now change bullet impact values while active in PvE\n&gt;   * Surrounded no longer multiplies precision damage on top of base damage, as it was benefiting some weapon types more than others as a result\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Legendary weapons have become too powerful overall. In many cases, they even outclass Exotic Primary weapons, so we\u2019re walking them all back a bit. All the way back in original Destiny, we had a perk named Crowd Control, which was Rampage\u2019s predecessor. Crowd Control capped out at a bonus of +15% extra damage. At this point in Destiny 2, Rampage caps out at about +67%. That\u2019s a 447% increase from the original iteration. Legendary damage perks have become so powerful, they simply invalidate non-damage related perks.\u00a0\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick preview of the three ritual weapons you can earn in Season of the Undying. Because these weapons are no longer pinnacle weapons, the quest required to earn them is not as in depth as previous seasons.\n\n\n###Vanguard\u2014Edgewise\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Edgewise.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8OoNWkJ.jpg)\n\n\n###Crucible\u2014Randy\u2019s Throwing Knife\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Randys_Throwing_Knife.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PM5QsSk.jpg)\n\n\n###Gambit\u2014Exit Strategy\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Exit_Strategy_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/QCvyZEs.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Set It Straight\n\nDuring the run up to launch, we\u2019ve been dropping videos, articles, interviews, and information all over the internets. Along the way, the fact-checkers called us out a few times. Today, we\u2019re issuing some corrections to previous transmissions.\n\n\n1. There was a shot of Trials of the Nine armor in the launch trailer by mistake. We wanted to clear up any confusion and let players know that the Trials of the Nine set will not obtainable in Season of the Undying.\n\n\n2. We also had to revise our gameplay calendar for Season of the Undying. The menu of action is the same, but we are adjusting the timing of the Nightmare Hunts. The new schedule looks like this:\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Destiny_SoU_Calendar_EN.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RbcJnvC.png)\n\n\n3. Back when we were first talking about finishers and some of the mods that go with them, we talked about how one of the mods enabled you to spawn Heavy ammo for your fireteam when you executed a finisher. That was still in flux at the time, and for balance reasons we ended up making a mod that will spawn Heavy ammo for yourself and a mod that will spawn Special ammo for your fireteam.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Wear It With Pride\n\nAt Bungie, our mission is to build worlds the inspire friendship. Our games become places where people\u2014all kinds of people\u2014can gather to share meaningful experiences. One of the most important aspects of friendship is acceptance. Earlier this year, we took to the streets as part of the Seattle Pride Parade. We also offered up a Pride Pin via the Bungie Store that was rumored to have an emblem that would come with it. The rumors are true, and we\u2019ve chosen International Coming Out Day as the advent to deploy the in-game expression of acceptance.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Pride.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/58LI4EX.jpg)\n\n\nFor the details, along with a personal story to capture the spirit of that day, here is one of our own\u2026\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Y\u2019all,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;My name\u2019s Nigel. You may know me from things like the [Shattered Throne Ride Along](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/418163901?t=00h12m01s), or this [wonderful fan video](https://youtu.be/UDpZbFdJ14Y?t=52) made during our St. Jude\u2019s charity stream. This is my first TWAB post and I\u2019m a little nervous, so I\u2019m going to use one of my favorite TV shows, Golden Girls, as a crutch.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Picture it. Tempe, Arizona 2009.\u00a0 A sophomore in college. At this point in my life, I\u2019d never really had a girlfriend or really found myself attracted to a woman. I refused to believe I was gay. Having seen so many coming-out stories go poorly, with family and friends abandoning people they loved, I didn\u2019t want that for myself. So I ignored it by playing video games.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Dragon Age: Origins had just released, and my twin brother had been bugging me for a good week to buy it and play it. Quickly I found myself wrapped in magic and steel for an untold, but probably perfectly healthy, amount of time. During this time, I found myself conversing with one of the male party members, simply trying to raise his approval.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That\u2019s when it appeared. The option to flirt with this character. I was as the kids say, \u201c[shooketh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMrh0MnCxw).\u201d I sat for what must have been twenty minutes before deciding to click on it. He flirted back. My heart skipped. I was a ball of nerves and anxiety as the conversation continued with another chance to confess romantic feelings to the character. I thought I was going to vomit all over a simple choice in a video game. I debated with myself, what did it mean that I wanted to flirt with this character? Why did I suddenly feel like my entire existence would be changed with this one conversation? I clicked it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;And that\u2019s when I learned about [rejection](https://media.giphy.com/media/a9xhxAxaqOfQs/giphy.gif). From a digital character. He wasn\u2019t gay, and my heart sunk. But his next words were something I didn\u2019t know I needed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with who you love. You are my friend no matter what.\u201d I spent the next two hours on the floor [crying](https://m.imgur.com/a/8WgexWA), finally feeling that it was okay to be gay. I felt more comfortable than I\u2019d ever felt in my life. I vowed, if I ever got the opportunity to pay it forward, I would.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Well I\u2019m helping to pay it forward. I\u2019ve spent a lot of my time at Bungie helping to make sure Destiny is a welcoming place. I have marched in the Seattle Pride Parade. I have helped set up the Trevor Foundation and other LGBTIQA+ charities. Most recently, I helped create those wonderful Bungie Pride Pins you keep seeing on our streams. I\u2019m happy to announce that, on October 11, International Coming Out Day, we\u2019ll be releasing a Pride emblem for your Guardian if you\u2019ve purchased this pin. If you missed the chance to buy the pin back in June, mark your calendars, because we\u2019ll be restocking our supply on the Bungie Store.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Destiny and Bungie are places where we can foster community and work together, no matter your background. We at Bungie want to make sure no matter who you love, or who you are, that everyone belongs in the Tower. Or the Farm, if you\u2019re into that.\n\n\nNigel speaks true. Thanks for being excellent to each other. Any players who previously purchased the Pride Pin will be receiving codes for the emblems through email.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Bungie Rewards\n\nLast week, we showed off a preview of the World\u2019s First belt and some of the emblems you can earn in our upcoming pinnacle PvE activity. We weren\u2019t quite ready to show off the awesome jacket Bungie Rewards will be offering, but the design is ready for the runway.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Raid_Jacket.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4TwWvYX.jpg)\n\n\nAny player who beats the \u201cGarden of Salvation\u201d raid and claims their code before the weekly reset on 10/15 will be eligible to purchase the raid jacket through Bungie Rewards. We are giving you some extra time to Power up this time. We know many of you don\u2019t enjoy rushing through content, so even if you aren\u2019t ready to take on the raid before 10/15, any player who completes \u201cGarden of Salvation\u201d during Season of the Undying will be eligible to purchase a special raid T-shirt through Bungie Rewards.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127658/Raid_Shirt.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UOzP0Wd.jpg)\n\n\nSo\u2026 the shirt has some spoilers on it, but we\u2019ll share out what it looks like after the raid is completed.\n\n\nThat\u2019s not all! Players can also claim a free Eris Morn papercraft mask by completing the main Shadowkeep quest by the end of Season 8. If you\u2019re already receiving Bungie newsletter emails, you\u2019ll get a direct link the next day, or you can visit [www.bungie.net/rewards](http://www.bungie.net/rewards) to redeem it. Stay tuned for more Bungie Rewards throughout the season.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Full Steam Ahead\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)\n\n\nPlayer Support is waiting in the wings to support our next launch.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Upcoming 24-Hour Maintenance\n&gt;\n&gt;This upcoming Monday, September 30, Destiny 1 and Destiny 2 will be taken offline for extended maintenance on all platforms.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**This maintenance will last for approximately 24 hours**, starting at 10 AM PDT (1700 UTC), ending with the launch of Destiny 2: Shadowkeep on October 1. During this downtime, players will be unable to log in to Bungie.net or access Destiny API features.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the latest information on this maintenance as it occurs, including download availability and emergent issues, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).\n&gt;\n&gt;###Pre-loading Destiny 2: Shadowkeep and Update 2.6.0\n&gt;\n&gt;Right now, [all PC players can pre-load Destiny 2 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085660/Destiny_2/), which includes pre-loading for [New Light](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight) and [Shadowkeep](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Shadowkeep). Since New Light makes Destiny 2 accessible to everyone for free, no purchase is necessary to pre-load.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Existing console players will be able to pre-load Update 2.6.0 during the maintenance leading up to launch. The moment we confirm that downloads are available, we\u2019ll sound off from the support links provided above.\n&gt;\n&gt;###FOLLOW UP: Delay in Forsaken License Transfers for Migrating PC Players\n&gt;\n&gt;[Last week](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48163), we discussed the likely delay of Forsaken license transfers for migrated PC players on Steam. With the announcement of our upcoming 24-hour maintenance, we hope to mitigate any possible delay in Forsaken license transfers following the launch of Shadowkeep on October 1. If any such delays occur, we\u2019ll be sure to sound off from the support links provided above.\n&gt;\n&gt;###PC Migration and New Characters on Steam\n&gt;\n&gt;Following the launch of Shadowkeep and Destiny 2 Update 2.6.0 on October 1, players who link their Steam account to their Bungie.net profile will be able to manually trigger PC Migration.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players should be aware, however, that any new characters created on Steam before performing PC migration will be overwritten when players migrate from Battle.net. This will result in the potential loss of new characters and gear, as well as Silver, Eververse items, and Season Passes\u2014if purchased on these new characters before performing PC migration.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To make things as simple as possible, here\u2019s the recommended order of operations for players who perform PC migration to Steam after Shadowkeep launches on October 1:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;1.\u00a0[Link your Steam account to your existing Bungie.net profile](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove) and initiate PC Migration. Please ensure you are linking to the same Bungie.net profile associated with your Battle.net account. **Once manually triggered, PC Migration cannot be undone.**\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;2. If desired, [enable Cross Save](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave) so your preferred characters are available when you log in to Destiny 2 on Steam. PC Migration will still transfer your Battle.net characters to Steam, even if another set of characters is selected for Cross Save. This also determines which characters receive any Silver or Season Passes purchased on Steam before logging in.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;3. On Steam, download and install [*Destiny 2*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085660/Destiny_2/). If you have not yet downloaded Steam, [click here](https://store.steampowered.com/about/).\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;4. Log in to Destiny 2.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;5. Your Battle.net characters, licenses, and Silver will already be migrated to your Steam account, however your Cross Saved characters will appear if Cross Save is enabled.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**IMPORTANT**: Since purchased Silver and Season Passes are applied to the first character set that players log in with after purchase, we **strongly** recommend that players enable Cross Save before logging in to Destiny 2 on Steam. This will ensure that your desired characters are receiving your Silver and Season Passes on the Steam platform. Cross Save-enabled characters will be able to bring their Season Passes with them to any platform after they have been applied.\n&gt;\n&gt;###REMINDER: Destiny 2 and Silver Purchases on Battle.net\n&gt;\n&gt;This week, we\u2019d like to remind PC players that Destiny 2 game content and Destiny 2 Silver can no longer be purchased from the Battle.net Shop.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Existing PC players can continue to play on Battle.net until Destiny 2 undergoes maintenance for Steam launch. Players should also be aware that in order for recent Silver purchases to successfully transfer to Steam, **players MUST log in to Destiny 2 on Battle.net\u00a0****before 10 AM PDT (1700 UTC) on September 30, 2019\u00a0****to claim their purchased Silver.**\n&gt;\n&gt;###**REMINDER: Battle.net Code Redemption for Destiny 2**\n&gt;\n&gt;As another reminder, **players should be aware that any Battle.net code they possess for Destiny 2 content MUST be redeemed on their Battle.net account before they perform PC Migration**. Players who have already prepared for PC Migration have until the start of Destiny 2 maintenance on **September 30** to redeem any unused Battle.net codes\u2014to have that license transfer to their Steam account.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who migrate to Steam after our October 1 maintenance must also ensure that their Battle.net code is redeemed before they link their Steam account. Once a Steam account is linked, their Guardians, Silver, and game licenses will be migrated from Battle.net to Steam. **This is a one-time process that cannot be repeated for new licenses**. For information on Battle.net code redemption, players should visit Blizzard\u2019s [How to Claim a Code](https://battle.net/support/article/11263) knowledgebase article.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s worth noting that all content previously included in the base Destiny 2 game, Curse of Osiris, or Warmind, will be available to all players for free through the launch of Destiny 2: New Light on October 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;###Steam Limited User Accounts\n&gt;\n&gt;Next week, Destiny 2 officially launches on Steam. Before it does, we\u2019d like to make players aware of Steam\u2019s Limited User Accounts.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In short, any player whose account has spent less than $5.00 USD on the Steam Store will have limited access to community and social features that are commonly used for spamming, phishing, and other abuse.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This will also apply to any Destiny 2 player new to the Steam platform who migrates from Battle.net. For more information, please see Valve\u2019s [Limited User Accounts](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-iagk-7663) support article.\n&gt;\n&gt;###Premonition Legendary Pulse Rifle\n&gt;\n&gt;Following the launch of Shadowkeep next week, players will be able to view new items added to Destiny 2 using the in-game Collections. Before then, we\u2019d like to make players aware of a known issue with one particular weapon listing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Following the launch of Shadowkeep, the Collection listing for the Premonition Legendary Pulse Rifle will state that it is \u201cfound by exploring the Moon.\u201d This weapon\u2019s specific source is actually the new dungeon, which will become available sometime after Shadowkeep\u2019s launch.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who encounter other issues following the launch of New Light, Shadowkeep, and Steam PC should report them to the [#Help](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help) forum.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##MOTW\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HQMBI5G.gif)\n\n\nAll right, let\u2019s see what we got.

You can see a bunch of those team members, either hard at work or talking about our goals, in the newest Bungie ViDoc. If you missed this invitation into our studio, give it a watch now. Or give it a watch again.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEvVKCKdtfw)\n\n\n*Shadowkeep* is just the beginning\u2014and it begins in under two weeks!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##They\u2019re Not Belts\n\nOn **Saturday**, October 5, Guardians will venture into a new raid: Garden of Salvation. Many of you have been to the Black Garden before, but don\u2019t be fooled\u2014an entirely new challenge awaits you.\u00a0\n\n\nContest mode will be active for the first 24 hours, similar to the [Crown of Sorrow World First competition](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47832). While Contest is active, players will face an enforced challenge throughout the raid. Power beyond certain levels will provide no additional advantage for a given fight (e.g., for the first fight, Power above 890 doesn\u2019t provide an advantage, and for the final fight, Power above 920 doesn\u2019t provide an advantage).\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the 24-hour period ends, we will disable Contest mode, and players can take full advantage of their higher Power to overcome the raid's challenges.\n\n\nAs always, we will be watching as fireteams race to claim the prestige of being World First to complete the raid. Their prize, besides bragging rights of course, will be this custom-made Garden of Salvation World First Belt.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/Raid_Belt.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dzVaw7e.jpg)\n\n\n[The Big Show](https://twitter.com/WWETheBigShow) pointed out during our World First ceremony at GuardianCon (now known as [GCX](https://twitter.com/GCXEvent)) this year, that they are not belts; they are titles. But since we have \u201ctitles\u201d in the game we are going to keep calling them belts. Sorry Big Show.\n\n\nYou can read the [full rules here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/47218). The gist is: Only the final six players of the winning fireteam to finish the activity will receive a belt. The first fireteam to complete the raid and return to orbit will be declared the winner. Unlike in previous raids, the winning team won\u2019t receive an Exotic drop from the final encounter, so don\u2019t rely on your loot stream to determine whether you may have won. We\u2019ll check our data before crowning the official winners from [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie).\n\n\nIf you are not first, you don\u2019t have to be last. All Guardians who complete the raid within the first 24 hours will be able to show off this exclusive emblem.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/Raid_emblem_24H.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pG3fPEU.jpg)\n\n\nWe also have this emblem available to anyone who completes the raid at their leisure.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127469/Raid_emblem_complete.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FUTC5Cv.jpg)\n\n\nStay tuned as we reveal more Bungie Rewards in Season of the Undying!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Applied Science\n\nThere has been an annoying bug in the UI where you would try to apply something like a shader or a mod and nothing would happen. The bar would fill up, but the desired action would not be applied. Sometimes it would fail multiple times. You could feel your blood pressure rise with each futile attempt. Back in update 2.5.0, we issued a fix for this issue. And it worked\u2026 kind of. But any fix that doesn\u2019t completely solve the problem is no fix it all. So we went back to work. We have a fix that should squash this bug for good coming up with Shadowkeep on October 1. Here is the **Destiny Dev Team** to give you some behind-the-scenes info on what was going on with the apply button and what we are doing to fix it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: The inconsistency of the apply button stems from overly aggressive safety features designed to protect your character from accidental UI interactions.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The first safety feature was cursor movement detection. If we noticed any amount of cursor movement while the apply button was held, we\u2019d cancel the action to prevent you from accidently applying your action to the wrong item. Because it is fairly easy to experience a small amount of mouse movement while clicking a mouse button, this restriction impacted PC players much more than console players. We removed the cursor movement detection in 2.5.0. Now we only check to see if the cursor has moved off the item.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The second safety feature is a bit more complicated. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re applying a mod. While you\u2019re holding down the button, a new mod shows up in your inventory at the start of the list, and shifts all the other mods displayed in the UI over one slot. The cursor is now hovering over a different mod, but the cursor hasn\u2019t moved. In this kind of situation, we want to make absolutely sure that we don\u2019t insert the wrong mod because that action can\u2019t be undone. To protect against this, we cancel the action if we detect any change to your character page. This is problematic because there are a myriad of stats we track and countless things happening around you that can cause a number on your character page to change. Even if you\u2019re sitting in orbit, getting a clan XP notification is enough to cancel the apply button.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While the protection described above serves as a good general safety net, it has clearly reached its limits. In 2.6.0, our plan is to tweak this protection. When we detect an update to your character page, we will check if the cursor is still hovering over the same item. If the cursor is still over the same item, we won\u2019t cancel the action.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Preparing for Launch\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126139/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)\n\n\n\nAs we go over our final checklists before launch, player support will be acting as your ground control. If your mission to the moon experiences any unexpected issues, let them know on the help forum and they\u2019ll get the right people working the problem. Remember to read the gauge before you stir the tanks.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###Update 2.6.0 Deployment and PC Migration\n&gt;\n&gt;This week, we\u2019d like to begin setting expectations on what the *[Shadowkeep](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Shadowkeep)* launch experience will be for existing PC players on October 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On October 1, prior to the official launch of *Shadowkeep*, *Destiny 2* will be taken offline for maintenance on all platforms. During this maintenance window, PC players who have [linked their Steam accounts](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove) to their Bungie.net profile will automatically have their Guardians and Silver transferred from Battle.net to Steam.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Once maintenance concludes and Shadowkeep has officially launched, PC players who\u2019ve undergone Steam linking will be able to launch *Destiny 2* on Steam and immediately access their Guardians and Silver. However, migrated PC players should be aware **that there will be a delay in the transfer of their *Destiny 2: Forsaken* licenses** from Battle.net to Steam.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;After the launch of Shadowkeep, *Forsaken* license transfers for Steam-linked PC players will continue in the background until they are complete. While that work is underway, PC players can access all *Destiny 2* content not reliant on a *Forsaken* license, as well as new Shadowkeep content if owned on Steam. And of course, all [*New Light*](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight) content will be available to all players, for free.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Examples of *Forsaken* content that will **not** be available to migrated PC players during this window:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* *Forsaken* campaign missions\n&gt;* *Forsaken* quest content\n&gt;* The Last Wish raid\n&gt;* The Shattered Throne dungeon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Examples of *Forsaken* activities that will be available to players immediately, since they will be bundled in with *New Light*:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Gambit playlist activities\n&gt;* *Forsaken* strikes in strike playlist activities\n&gt;* *Forsaken* maps in Crucible playlist activities\n&gt;* Patrols on the Tangled Shore destination\n&gt;* Patrols on the Dreaming City destination\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For information on maintenance times when they become available, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Battle.net Code Redemption for *Destiny 2*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Another item of housekeeping as we transition from Battle.net to Steam is about the redemption of *Destiny 2* codes for Battle.net.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Players should be aware that any Battle.net code they possess for *Destiny 2* content MUST be redeemed on their Battle.net account before they perform PC Migration**. Players who have already prepared for PC Migration have until the start of *Destiny 2* maintenance on October 1 to redeem any unused Battle.net codes \u2013 to have that license transfer to their Steam account.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who migrate to Steam after our October 1 maintenance must also ensure that their Battle.net code is redeemed before they link their Steam account. Once a Steam account is linked, their Guardians, Silver, and game licenses will be automatically migrated from Battle.net to Steam. **This is a one-time process that cannot be repeated for new licenses.** For information on Battle.net code redemption, players should visit Blizzard\u2019s [How to Claim a Code](https://battle.net/support/article/11263)\u00a0knowledgebase article.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s worth noting that all content which was previously included in the base *Destiny 2* game, Curse of Osiris, or Warmind, will be available to all players for free through the launch of *Destiny 2*: *New Light* on October 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###REMINDER: Steam Linking and PC Migration\n&gt;\n&gt;Once again, we\u2019d like to remind PC players to [link their Steam accounts](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove) to their Bungie.net profile in preparation for our migration to Steam on October 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;From October 1 onward, any existing PC player who links a Steam account to their Bungie.net profile will automatically be migrated forward to the Steam ecosystem.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To prevent the unintentional loss of Guardians, game licenses, and Silver, **it is imperative that all PC players make sure they are linking their correct Steam AND Battle.net accounts to their Bungie.net profile.**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;###REMINDER: *Destiny 2* and Silver Purchases on Battle.net\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019d also like to remind PC players that *Destiny 2* game content and *Destiny 2* Silver can no longer be purchased from the Battle.net shop.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Existing PC players can continue to play on Battle.net until *Destiny 2* migrates to Steam on October 1. At that time, new players are also welcome to jump in with the launches of [*New Light*](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight) and [Shadowkeep](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Shadowkeep).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, every existing PC player should be aware that in order for recent Silver purchases to successfully transfer to Steam, players MUST log in to *Destiny 2* on Battle.net before October 1 to claim their purchased Silver.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Existing Campaign Progress and *New Light*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Lastly, this week we\u2019d like to make players aware of how *New Light* will impact their existing progress for the Red War, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and *Forsaken* campaigns.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On October 1, after *Destiny 2* Update 2.6.0 rolls out, players who have not completed any of the above *Destiny 2* campaigns will have progress toward that campaign reset. For example: any player who has not completed the *Forsaken* campaign will have to restart that campaign after 2.6.0 maintenance on October 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s worth noting, however, that most endgame activities will generally be available to players as soon as they unlock their corresponding destinations. This is as a part of the accelerated player progression that will be introduced with *New Light* on October 1.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Silence You Phones**\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1NnjBBT.gif)\n\n\nOnce again we honor creative players in our community with a little something called Movie of the Week. This is where we pick our favorite community-made videos and award their creators with a special emblem.\u00a0\n\n\n**Movie of the Week**: Oh Listener Mine\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjxPD8eJzeo)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention**: Jotunn for Real\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/_OY8M9W9KTA)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s good to be back. I\u2019ve kept an eye on things, checking in on the community during late-night feedings, but it\u2019s nice to finally be back in the studio where it happens. Just in time too, as Dmg required a [jumpstart to get his ticker ticking correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d50bnb/big_reddit_get_well_soon_to_dmg04/f0ixnnd/). Send him some lov[e](https://i.imgur.com/kjmBjXy.jpg) as he rests up.\n\n\nShadowkeep is just around the corner. Next week will be the final TWAB before we let you loose on the Moon. From there, things escalate quickly with the raid and a full calendar of content going live throughout the Season of the Undying. See you soon on the Moon.\u00a0\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1086798, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week at Bungie - 9/19/2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569017606, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d6l8js/this_week_at_bungie_9192019/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collections": [{"author_id": "t2_mocx5", "author_name": "DTG_Bot", "collection_id": "3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "created_at_utc": 1565530291.728, "description": "A list of all This Week At Bungie posts.", "display_layout": null, "last_update_utc": 1568323405.349, "link_ids": ["t3_af25cd", "t3_ah481q", "t3_ajsedl", "t3_alvfka", "t3_ao9wte", "t3_aqpxzn", "t3_at9ul5", "t3_avx91v", "t3_ayk8tz", "t3_b15gjp", "t3_b3wyr2", "t3_b6obl3", "t3_b9k4wk", "t3_bc5jkp", "t3_besokf", "t3_bhe8w9", "t3_bk1cnt", "t3_bmpymm", "t3_bpj5x6", "t3_bs9s8g", "t3_buzcp4", "t3_bxmngp", "t3_c0c9sb", "t3_c311of", "t3_c6bun6", "t3_cc0flf", "t3_cez1le", "t3_chufi1", "t3_ckuatg", "t3_cnreiv", "t3_cqwvcm", "t3_cu4h82", "t3_cx5ul9", "t3_d07vph", "t3_d3eovr"], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/collection/3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "title": "This Week At Bungie"}], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568323405, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d3eovr/this_week_at_bungie_9122019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d3eovr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2654, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d3eovr/this_week_at_bungie_9122019/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1568323405, "score": 3483, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48141\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we\u2019re looking into the near future.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve talked a lot about how *Shadowkeep* will change the way we play *Destiny*, and we\u2019re not even done yet. We\u2019ll have more to say before October 1 about how the game is about to evolve. There might even be a final pre-launch Bungie ViDoc about Year Three next week, but that\u2019s not my promise to make. Keep your eyes up.\n\n\nSeeing Guardians rejoin Eris on the Moon for a new adventure is not the only thing we\u2019re looking forward to when we daydream launch day.

For this pass, the team put some love in to a few Exotics that may have been collecting dust in your vaults. On top of that, a bit of tuning has been done in how damage is applied to different targets in PvE environments.\n\n\nIn terms of how these changes will impact your PvP experience, a few weapons and archetypes are being buffed, with some seeing more aggressive range falloff to give breathing room to Scout Rifles and other weapons.\n\n\n**Weapon Changes - General**\n\n\n\n* Weapon mods are now treated as reusable unlocks instead of consumables. Any mods you have in your inventory will be converted to unlocks\n\n\n   * This gives players the opportunity to play with different mods more frequently\n   * If the only copy of a mod you have is already in a gun, you will need to reacquire one to unlock it\n* Auto Rifles\n\n\n   * PvE damage increased between +30% and +25% depending on combatant rank\n* Bows\n\n\n   * PvE damage increased by +31% against minor enemies, and +26% against major enemies\n   * Fixed an issue where bow draw times were displayed incorrectly in the inspection screen\n* Hand Cannons\n\n\n   * PvE damage against minor enemies increased by 30%\n   * Lightweight and Adaptive hand cannons use a new firing animation while aiming down sights\n\n\n      * This change was made to increase weapon accuracy when firing these weapons as fast as possible\n      * Ex: Currently, players can shoot faster than the recoil animation of 140/150 archetypes \u2013 so while the handcannon looks to have fully reset from recoil, the following projectile will be shot as if the weapon was still in a recoiled state.\n   * Reduced the effect the range stat has on damage range falloff (effective range) for this weapon archetype\n* Machine Guns\n\n\n   * PvE damage against minor enemies increased by 25%\n   * Increased the effects of damage range falloff on this weapon archetype\n* Pulse Rifles\n\n\n   * PvE damage against minor enemies increased by 28%\n   * Increased the effects of damage range falloff on this weapon archetype.\n   * Archetype specific damage changes (impacts both PvE and PvP gameplay)\n\n\n      * Rapid-Fire Pulse Rifles now deal 14/23.8 base/precision damage (Previously 13/21.4)\n      * High Impact Pulse Rifles now deal 21/33.6 base/precision damage (Previously 20/32)\n* Scout Rifles\n\n\n   * PvE damage increased between +36% and +18% depending on combatant rank\n* Sidearms\n\n\n   * PvE damage increased to minor and major combatants by 16%\n* Sniper Rifles\n\n\n   * PvE damage increased by +47% against minor enemies, +20% for others\n\n\n      * Exotic sniper rifle perk damage bonuses have been modified to compensate for this change and they will not receive the full benefits as a result\n* Submachineguns\n\n\n   * PvE damage increased by 22.5% against minor/major combatants\n   * Aggressive Frame\n\n\n      * Removed the intrinsic effect of \"Deals bonus damage at close range.\"\n      * This bonus was 10%, but was unintentionally always active\n      * The bonus damage has been moved to the base damage for 750 RPM Submachineguns, resulting in no damage change\n      * As a result, Tarrabah and The Huckleberry gain 10% damage in both PvE and PvP\n\n\n**Exotics**\n\n\n\n* Sweet Business\n\n\n   * Increased magazine size from 100 to 150.\n   * Increased PvE damage by 15%.\n   * High Caliber rounds have been replaced with Armor Piercing rounds.\n   * Damage changed to 15/21.2 base/precision (Previously 13.21/21.14)\n   * This weapon no longer requires you to be firing when you pick up ammo to have it automatically reload.\n* Graviton Lance\n\n\n   * PvE damage increased by 30%\n* Sunshot\n\n\n   * Increased magazine size to 12\n* Vigilance Wing\n\n\n   * PvE damage increased by 25%\n* Crimson\n\n\n   * Damage changed to 19/30.5 base/precision (Previously 13.76/24.75)\n   * Fixed an issue that was causing this weapon to deal higher flinch than intended\n* Merciless\n\n\n   * Fixed the missing aim assist stat for this weapon\n* Ace of Spades\n\n\n   * Memento Mori's damage bonus is now affected by range falloff\n* Lumina\n\n\n   * Noble Rounds should apply their buff to allies more reliably now\n* The Colony\n\n\n   * \"Serve the Colony\" now functions as Auto Loading Holster does\n\n\n**Perks**\n\n\n\n* Subsistence\n\n\n   * Reduced the impact of this perk on total reserves\n* Ricochet Rounds\n\n\n   * Removed the hidden bonus to damage falloff\n* Swashbuckler\n\n\n   * Perk now activates when getting a kill with Ball Lightning\n* Grave Robber\n\n\n   * Perk now activates when getting a kill with ranged melee abilities (ie: Ball Lightning, Explosive Knife)\n* One-Two Punch\n\n\n   * Reduced the effectiveness of stacking One-Two Punch and Cross Counter (Liar's Handshake)\n   * Ex: Players won\u2019t be able to defeat Riven in less than three seconds after *Shadowkeep* launches using the combo of One-Two Punch and Liar's Handshake, but we know many of you will try other builds\u2026 and potentially even succeed.\u00a0\n\n\nWe still have a few TWAB\u2019s before the release of *Shadowkeep*, which will shore up our patch notes previews on a variety of topics, ranging from Black Armory Access to bug fixes. Stay tuned!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Reckoning: One more thing\u2026\n\n*Destiny 2* Update 2.5.2.2 recently brought some frequently requested Quality of Life changes to Reckoning and rewards. Next week, we\u2019ll be making one additional change to the experience, further bridging the gap between you and your desired rewards.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127276/Reckoning_Guns.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CAyqHOF.jpg)\n\n\nStarting on September 17, all negative modifiers will be removed from Reckoning. This activity will continue to feature a weekly single, with a daily rotation of Brawler, Grenadier, and Heavyweight. Our goal in this change is to improve the replay-ability of Reckoning, so players will feel more inclined to hop in to matchmaking for some sweet loot. This should also help to address some feedback items from players that specific modifiers could feel too punishing (We\u2019re looking at you, Blackout Darkblades).\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get your hands on some weapons from Season of the Drifter that have eluded you, I reckon this is your time to shine.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##One after another\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126139/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/825aDr2.gif)\n\n\nFresh on the heels of Update 2.5.2.2, we\u2019re prepping 2.5.2.3. **Destiny Player Support** already has your itinerary prepared, so you\u2019ll be prepared for the upcoming download.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;***Destiny 2* Hotfix 2.5.2.3**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next week, Hotfix 2.5.2.3 will become available to players in *Destiny 2*. This hotfix targets an issue which is currently preventing a subset of players from enabling Cross Save, and marks the removal of negative modifiers from The Reckoning.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For deployment times when they are available, follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**REMINDER: Steam Linking and PC Migration**\n&gt;\n&gt;For the next several weeks, we\u2019ll be reminding PC players to [link their Steam accounts](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove) to their Bungie.net profile, in preparation for our migration to Steam on October 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;From October 1 onward, any existing PC player who links a Steam account to their Bungie.net profile will automatically be migrated forward to the Steam ecosystem.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To prevent the unintentional loss of Guardians, game licenses, and Silver, it is imperative that all PC players make sure they are linking their correct Steam account to their Bungie.net profile.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**REMINDER: *Destiny 2* and Silver Purchases on Battle.net**\n&gt;\n&gt;For the next several weeks, we\u2019ll also be reminding players that *Destiny 2* game content and *Destiny 2* Silver can no longer be purchased from the Battle.net Shop.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Existing PC players can continue to play on Battle.net until *Destiny 2* migrates to Steam on October 1. At that time, new players are also welcome to jump in with the launches of *[New Light](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight)* and *[Shadowkeep](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Shadowkeep)*.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, every existing PC player should be aware that in order for recent Silver purchases to successfully transfer to Steam, players MUST log in to *Destiny 2* on Battle.net before October 1 to claim their purchased Silver.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Saw something Husky happen on Mars\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bZkXS5M.gif)\n\n\nImitation is the sincerest form of flattery. For some of you *Destiny* old timers, Husky Raids began a trend in content creation, staging wonderful music videos on the destinations of *Destiny*. They inspired many to dance to their favorite tracks from the methane seas of Titan to the rocky outcroppings of IO. This week, our runner up is an homage, and we loved every second of it.\n\n\nOur selection for Movie of the Week just barely edged a win, thanks to some killer tunes and a wonderful array of action from the last two years of *Destiny 2*. Some of the clips may bring forth wonderful memories before we take our first steps into Year 3.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Princes of the Universe**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/AsJCHLFuKyo)\n\n\n**Honorable mention: Saw some strange activity on Mars during Community Week**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/zNpZgXCxdSI)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to put your name in the hat for Movie of the Week, make sure to post your content to the [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) on bungie.net, or throw a video to [myself](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04) or [Cozmo](https://twitter.com/Cozmo23) on Twitter.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThis week was home to *Destiny\u2019s* 5th year anniversary. As I (might) still have your attention, I\u2019d like to tell you a quick story. Five years ago, I was your average Bungie community member. I worked a retail job in San Diego, playing videogames into the dead of night and enjoying time with the communities therein. I had a few ideas on a future, ranging from Architecture to Graphic Design, but wasn\u2019t set on anything just yet. The summer before *Destiny* shipped, DeeJ shot me an email asking if I wanted to help show off *Destiny\u2019s* upcoming \u201cCrucible\u201d PvP environment at E3. It was a gamer\u2019s dream, going to E3 and playing a new game early, surrounded by folks eager to see the new stuff. Not only did I meet some wonderful people that I have the pleasure of working with today, I had the opportunity to make some friends from other corners of the Bungie community.\n\n\nA few days in, I was introduced to a very tall man that went by the name of *Cozmo*. He was funny, somewhat awkward, and seemed to be the type that would throw something at me for no good reason at all. All things considered, I thought he was a pretty nice guy. He\u2019d just made a new subreddit to follow the development of *Destiny*. While most of what could be found was purely speculation, it had already grown into a small community. There are many parts of the story that I won\u2019t bore you with, but it was the beginning of a wonderful friendship that holds to this day. *Destiny* has always had that quality about it, making friendships a sort of loot that could be acquired through pure luck. End of the day, I\u2019m glad to have found a perfect roll for a fellow Community Manager, even before we had applied for the gig.\n\n\nThank you to everyone who shared their stories on how a game could positively impact their lives. That\u2019s one of the things about community that we love most, and we appreciate that you\u2019re a part of ours. With 5 years behind us, it\u2019s almost time to take our next step. Two TWAB\u2019s and a weekend stand between us and *Shadowkeep*. Feel free to start counting the sleeps.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nDmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1078774, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 9/12/2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568409792, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d3eovr/this_week_at_bungie_9122019/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collections": [{"author_id": "t2_mocx5", "author_name": "DTG_Bot", "collection_id": "3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "created_at_utc": 1565530291.728, "description": "A list of all This Week At Bungie posts.", "display_layout": null, "last_update_utc": 1567722439.886, "link_ids": ["t3_af25cd", "t3_ah481q", "t3_ajsedl", "t3_alvfka", "t3_ao9wte", "t3_aqpxzn", "t3_at9ul5", "t3_avx91v", "t3_ayk8tz", "t3_b15gjp", "t3_b3wyr2", "t3_b6obl3", "t3_b9k4wk", "t3_bc5jkp", "t3_besokf", "t3_bhe8w9", "t3_bk1cnt", "t3_bmpymm", "t3_bpj5x6", "t3_bs9s8g", "t3_buzcp4", "t3_bxmngp", "t3_c0c9sb", "t3_c311of", "t3_c6bun6", "t3_cc0flf", "t3_cez1le", "t3_chufi1", "t3_ckuatg", "t3_cnreiv", "t3_cqwvcm", "t3_cu4h82", "t3_cx5ul9", "t3_d07vph"], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/collection/3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "title": "This Week At Bungie"}], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567722439, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d07vph/this_week_at_bungie_952019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d07vph", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3125, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d07vph/this_week_at_bungie_952019/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1567722440, "score": 1693, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48124\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, Mars is on the mind.\n\n\nA few weeks ago, we forecast our first Community Challenge. Our destination of choice: Mars. With a unique emblem and additional Menagerie loot to earn, we knew you\u2019d take this on\u2026 but we didn\u2019t think you\u2019d prosecute the Hive this quickly. To say we\u2019re impressed with your progress is an understatement. Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of how far you\u2019ve come in so little time:\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127093/Mars_Community_Challenge_Update-19-09-05.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ecSed3n.jpg)\n\n\nRemember, to qualify for the exclusive Community Event emblem, you'll need to complete one Nightfall before next Tuesday at 10:00 AM Pacific. Luckily, it looks like there's some work to be done in the Nightfall department. Don't forget, we have the [Find Fireteam feature on Bungie.net and the Destiny Companion App](https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/FireteamSearch?activityType=0&amp;platform=0) if you're in need of some team mates. We'll be sending out emblems to qualifying players next week, so be sure to stay tuned for updates.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve got some exciting news on the docket this week. A Bungie Bounty, upcoming Crucible changes, Sandbox ability tuning, and a fashion show of upcoming armor. Let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Join the Strike Team\n\nNext week, we\u2019re assembling a special strike team for another Bungie Bounty\u2014and, like we always do, we\u2019re leaving a seat open. In keeping with our streaming tradition, this is your chance to find us in the wilds of matchmaking and engage in live combat with the hopes of winning an emblem as your reward. On this occasion, we\u2019re putting a price on the heads of whichever strike bosses the fates choose.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Bungie Bounty\u2014Strike Team Edition**\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny 2 on Xbox Live**\n&gt;\n&gt;**Heroic Strike Playlist**\n&gt;\n&gt;**Tuesday, September 10**\n&gt;\n&gt;**3\u20135 PM PDT**\n&gt;\n&gt;**[www.mixer.com/Bungie](http://www.mixer.com/Bungie)**\n\n\nIf matchmaking chooses you to play on this fireteam, your fellow Guardians will be two titans of industry (even though one of them plays as a Hunter). These are two old friends who have recently been reunited by Cross Save. They\u2019ll be live at Bungie to stream their session.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127093/Pete_Phil_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Dh2J3Mr.jpg)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you get matched up with these Guardians, and they decide that you held up your end of the fight, they\u2019ll award you an emblem you can use to prove it\u2014so be sure to back them up on the path to victory. Look alive and play your best game. This will be your first chance to win the*&amp;nbsp;Destiny 2* Year 3 Bungie Bounty emblem. Check it out!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127093/Bountry_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/d51sFoV.jpg)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019ll launch as many strikes as time permits, with a different Guardian from the community as the third player. If you\u2019re watching and participating in chat, there will also be some prizes for you to win as a spectator. We\u2019ll have seven *Destiny 2: Shadowkeep* Collector\u2019s Editions to award\u2014and those are otherwise sold out.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127093/CE_Soldout.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Ti16Dlq.jpg)\n\n\nOur friends at Xbox also have some special prizes up their sleeves, so tune in to watch or queue up to fight alongside two of the biggest *Destiny* fans we know.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Shake Shaxx\u00a0\n\nMany of you have been asking how the Crucible experience will change on October 1. While we outlined some changes in the [Director\u2019s Cut: Part III](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48072) article, we wanted to put the magnifying glass on a few more upcoming changes.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127093/Crucible_Menu.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Rt9dqmI.jpg)\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Director Update**\n&gt;\n&gt;When *Shadowkeep* launches, your Crucible Director will look a bit different. Here\u2019s a quick rundown from the Director\u2019s Cut:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* We\u2019ve removed the Quickplay and Competitive nodes from the Director.\n* If you\u2019re looking for an experience like Quickplay, we\u2019ve added Classic Mix (a connection-based playlist [like Quickplay today]). Classic Mix includes Control, Clash, and Supremacy.\u00a0\n* Competitive is replaced by 3v3 Survival (which now awards Glory).\n* We\u2019ve also added a Survival Solo Queue playlist that also awards Glory.\u00a0\n* We\u2019ve added 6v6 Control as its own playlist.\u00a0\n\n\n   * With the potential influx of new players this fall, we want to have a playlist that signals to new players where to start.\u00a0\n   * We feel like 6v6 Control is the right starting place when introducing new friends to *Destiny*.\n* We\u2019ve added a weekly 6v6 rotator and a weekly 4v4 rotator.\u00a0\n\n\n   * These rotator playlists are where modes like Clash, Supremacy, Mayhem, Lockdown, and Countdown will appear.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We want to create some variety in the PvP experience from Season to Season, and one way we\u2019re doing that is to bench some maps for the Season. While they\u2019re out of rotation, if time allows we also hope to improve how they play by tweaking spawn areas, ammo spawns, and overall structure so they return better than before. The first four to be removed from all playlists are:\n\n\n* Dead Cliffs\n* Legion\u2019s Gulch\n* Retribution\n* Solitude\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We also made a pass on all playlists, removing some maps from playlists where they don\u2019t shine.\u00a0 Equinox is now only in Scorched, Mayhem, and Breakthrough, and Firebase Echo is only in Supremacy, Mayhem, and Breakthrough.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we are removing a few maps, we are also introducing Widow\u2019s Court, Twilight Gap, and the new map, Fragment. Think Dreaming City meets Infinite Forest.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/127/127093/Fragment.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sUGs0h0.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Elimination is also making its return to *Destiny 2* via Crucible Labs. We\u2019ll be testing out multiple variants of Elimination rulesets and settings to see how the mode plays with the new weapons and abilities of *Destiny 2*.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Heavy Ammo Sharing**\n&gt;\n&gt;Heavy ammo is shared only in all 6v6 modes, and those crates have a sparkling effect to denote this. Once a player picks up Heavy ammo, their teammates have a limited amount of time (currently 7 seconds\u2014this is something we can tweak between Seasons based on community feedback) to interact with the same ammo crate to get Heavy ammo. If the other team picked up the crate, it will turn red to indicate you cannot pick it up during this period. When the time window expires, the crate despawns.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Each player gets less Heavy ammo from shared crates than they do from unshared crates in 4v4 and 3v3 modes. The amount of ammo you receive from a crate is static and does not change based on how many teammates share the crate.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Rank Systems Update: Streaks and Floors**\n&gt;\n&gt;Glory, Valor, and Infamy streaks have been made more resilient. Instead of resetting your streak, losses will now reduce your Valor and Infamy streaks by 1, and your Glory streak by 2. You can still lose Glory, but if your rank is at or below Fabled, you can\u2019t lose Glory if doing so would drop you below that rank (each rank through Fabled acts as a floor for Glory).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Competitive Matchmaking Updates: Skill and Glory**\n&gt;\n&gt;*Destiny* has always tracked player skill behind the scenes, taking into account things like kills, damage dealt, and so forth. These factors all contribute to a player\u2019s skill rating. In Season 8, we\u2019ve mapped skill ratings to Glory ranks, with the lowest end of the scale mapping to Guardian I, and the high end mapping to Legend. Most players are somewhere between these extremes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As you play in the Survival playlist, the Glory system will accelerate you to the rank that corresponds to your skill rating. If your current rank is below where your skill rating says you should be, you\u2019ll earn extra Glory based on the criteria above so you can get to your expected rank faster and lose less Glory so you don\u2019t fall farther away. Once you reach your \u201cexpected\u201d rank, Glory gains and losses will normalize.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Meanwhile, your skill rating is continually adjusting based on your performance, shifting the system\u2019s understanding of your \u201cexpected\u201d rank, and causing the Glory system to respond by pulling you toward that rank. The result should be that over time, your Glory rank will become an accurate reflection of your skill. It also means that teammates of different skill will experience different Glory adjustments from the same Survival match.\n\n\nWhen it comes to Crucible, matchmaking and hopper nodes are only half of the puzzle. Over the next two weeks, we\u2019ll be detailing Sandbox changes, which directly impact the meta that you\u2019d find in our PvP environment.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Shadowkeep Sandbox Update: Abilities\n\n\nAs *Destiny 2* continues to evolve with the upcoming release of *Shadowkeep*, many of the tools in your space magic toolbox are receiving a tuning pass. This week, we\u2019ll be focusing on subclass changes, as the list is fairly hefty. Below, we\u2019ve paired developer commentary with upcoming patch notes to paint a picture of how your abilities are being updated\u2014and, more importantly, why.\n\n\n**Buffs**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Nightstalker Way of the Pathfinder (Bottom)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Goal:** We want to lean into the fantasy of a speedy disruptor. Pathfinders need more tools to scout the battlefield and a skill based way to engage with that gameplay more often. We should reward this scouting and battlefield control gameplay, executed well, with more opportunities to do the same. At the same time shadow shot needed some quality of life improvements for long standing frustrations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Vanish:** Smoke bomb grants invisibility to allies\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Gives 1 stack of Heart of the Pack (newly revamped) to all allies hit\n&gt;* Grants +34 to armor, recovery, and agility\n&gt;* Gives weapon reload speed and handling\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Max 3 stacks\n&gt;* Increased invisibility duration from 7 &gt; 8 seconds.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Provision:** Killing tethered enemies creates super orbs and increases agility, armor, and recovery for allies\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* New Perk (old perk benefits moved to be part of Mobius Quiver)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Damaging enemies with your grenades reduces the cooldown of your smoke bomb (6% per damage tick)\n&gt;   * Making allies invis gives you grenade energy (17.5% per ally)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Moebius Quiver:** Fire super multiple times and deals massive damage to tethered targets\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Added the old Provision perk to naturally be part of Mobius Quiver\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Killing tethered enemies creates super orbs and grants stacks of Heart of the Pack for allies\n&gt;* Expanded the range of Heart of the Pack from 20 &gt; 30 meters.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Shadowshot Super (Top and Bottom path)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Damage increased from 150 &gt; 250\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * One shot kill in PvP\n&gt;* Improved tether accuracy near obstacles\n&gt;* Suppress on hit is more consistent\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sentinel Code of the Protector (Top)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Goal:** This path is the main support role for Titans and focuses heavily on melee kills while staying near allies. We want to focus more heavily on buffing allies so that players care about the timing of their buff usage. With a loop which allows players to get their melee energy back more quickly this will be a more engaging path to play. Additionally, Ward of Dawn is currently not up to snuff, and needs a buff that ties in to the fantasy of buffing allies.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Defensive Strike:** Melee ability that creates an overshield for nearby allies\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* All kills while the overshield is active grant melee energy for the player with the shield (works for all allies you grant a shield to)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * This is based upon enemy threat level from 5% (minors) to 25% (players and bosses)**Rallying Force:** Melee kills heal nearby allies\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Heal buffed from 10 health and 10 shields to 10 health and 20 shields (50% increase)**Ward of Dawn:** Alternate super that creates a shield bubble\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Increase ward health versus supers\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Most supers will require the whole thing to be dumped on the ward to destroy it but will (usually) not kill the players inside.\n&gt;* Ward grants weapons of light buff when passing through it (35% weapon damage for 15 seconds)\n&gt;* Grants an additional super orb (3)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Auto-generated orbs now grant the same amount of super energy as regular super orbs (previously the orbs gave less super energy on par with masterwork orbs)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sentinel Code of the Aggressor (Bottom)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Shield Bash:** Shoulder charge that disorients nearby enemies\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Now suppresses the target hit and any enemy within 2 meters (have to be basically right next to them)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Voidwalker Attunement of Hunger (Bottom)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Vortex:** Nova Bomb leaves behind a damaging AoE pool\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Initial explosion damage increased 15%\n&gt;* Lingering damage increased 15%\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dawnblade Attunement of Grace**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Well of Radiance:** Alternate super that creates a healing/buffing field for allies\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Grants an additional super orb (3)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Auto-generated orbs now grant the same amount of super energy as regular super orbs (previously the orbs gave less super energy on par with masterwork orbs)\n\n\n**Nerfs**\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Nightstalker Way of the Trapper (Top)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Shadowshot:** Fires an arrow that damages enemies and debuffs enemies nearby\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Damage sharing for the Nightstalker player specifically reduced from 100% to 50%\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Now all allied players have 50% damage sharing on tether\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Nightstalker Way of the Wraith (Middle)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Flawless Execution:** Headshot kills while crouched grant invisibility and truesight\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Truesight now lasts 3 seconds (down from 9)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Shattering Strike:** After performing a Flawless Execution, your melee attacks have a longer lunge range and weaken enemies\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Advanced warning: When we made the change to Flawless Execution this also unintentionally nerfed this ability to only last 3 seconds (it was directly tied to the truesight). We have prepared a fix for the 4.6.1 patch to restore the weaken and lunge range increase to last the entire 9 seconds regardless of truesight and invisibility status.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Instant Reloading**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Goal:** In the beginning, Lunafactions and Rally Barricade did exist, but they were clunky to use. They still had dramatic impact on gameplay even in that state, but eventually we decided to make their effects easier to handle. The problems they introduced always existed in the game, but over time these have become magnified due to new abilities, perks, and weapons introduced into the *Destiny 2* sandbox. The impact of something that takes all reloading out of the equation means that other perks or effects like the Hunter\u2019s Marksman Dodge or the Sealed Ahamkara\u2019s Grasps can simply fall to the wayside \u2013 Even swords take a hit in comparison, being one of the few weapons that naturally never needs to reload.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Reloading is one of those mechanics that are simple, but have wide ranging consequences. Because the effect on gameplay of removing reloading is inversely proportional to the size of your weapon\u2019s magazine and how slow your general reload animations are, weapons like Rocket Launchers and Shotguns can benefit greatly compared to other weapons. This, alongside the increase in general access to damage bonus effects like Well of Radiance left us with the decision to remove this effect from these two sources, as they were causing things to quickly snowball out of control.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Titan Rally Barricade**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* This ability now provides a large increase to reload speed for the duration of the effect\n&gt;* This ability no longer automatically reloads your weapons from reserves\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Warlock Rift/Well of Radiance**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Lunafaction Boots now provides a large increase to reload speed for the duration of Well of Radiance\n&gt;* This exotic no longer automatically reloads your weapons from reserves\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Super Energy Regeneration**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Goal:** These changes will reduce the speed with which players are able to earn their super which supports difficulty and reduces the current ability to trivialize certain content through excessively chaining supers. Systemically, we want to reduce base sources of supers on a large macro scale without diminishing the feeling that your actions are gaining you a worthwhile energy boost. By reducing the speed at which you gain super we can make mods and perks feel more worthwhile. We still want it to feel like you can make meaningful progress not only through normal play but by augmenting super energy through teamwork, class choices, gear, and skillful play.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**New Energy Granted by Super Orbs:**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Super Orb: 7.143% (50% reduction)\n&gt;* Masterwork Orb: 2.5% (50% reduction)\n&gt;* Kills: (25% reduction)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Minor: 0.6%\n&gt;   * Elite: 0.96%\n&gt;   * Mini-boss: 1.8%\n&gt;   * Boss: 3%\n&gt;   * Player: 3%\n&gt;* Assists: (25% reduction)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Minor: 0.3%\n&gt;   * Elite: 0.48%\n&gt;   * Mini-boss: 0.9%\n&gt;   * Boss: 1.5%\n&gt;   * Player: 1.5%\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Damage Multipliers**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Goal:** At *Destiny 2* launch, damage buffs were fairly sparse \u2013 There was Empowering Rift for a small increase, and you could combine it with a weakening effect such as Hammer Strike, but very little else. As time has gone on, we introduced Well of Radiance, Weapons of Light, Guiding Flame, Frontal Assault, etc, and combining these effects has resulted in player damage output far beyond what was previously available. Even with just a small amount of them, a player can go from 1x damage to 3x and beyond, causing there to be an extremely large gap between standard player output and theoretical output.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;By preventing the larger effects from stacking, we are able to keep each of them around without having to do something in response like raise boss health to compensate for these tactics, as well as create more of them. As an example, Lumina would not have been created in world where the damage bonus effect of Noble Rounds stacked with other damage effects, and these changes are simply an extension along those same lines.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While the weakening effects never stacked, we also took a look at them and adjusted their values as many of our more powerful units would simply evaporate when touched by one of them, but we compensated for that in other ways, such as either extending the duration of the effect or in the case of Shadowshot, making it affect power weapons.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Player Damage Buffs**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Player Bonuses\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Bonus damage effects that apply to all of a player's weapons simultaneously no longer stack multiplicatively. The highest applicable bonus will be used instead.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * This does not affect single weapon buffs such as Rampage, Kill Clip, or exotic weapons that increase their own damage. These will still stack multiplicatively.\n&gt;      * Buffs that provide bonus damage will still exist simultaneously on the player, so in the event that the one with the highest multiplier wears off the next highest will be used instead.\n&gt;      * This change affects the following weapons/abilities (Empowering Rift, Frontal Assault, Guiding Flame, Sun Warrior, Inertia Override, Well of Radiance, Lumina/Noble Rounds, Weapons of Light)\n&gt;* Notable exceptions: Vengeance (One Eyed Mask)\n&gt;* Frontal Assault\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Bonus damage is now +20% (Previously +25%)\n&gt;* Sun Warrior\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Bonus damage is now +20% (Previously +25%)\n&gt;* Well of Radiance\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Bonus damage is now +25% (Previously +35%)\n&gt;* Weapons of Light\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Bonus damage is now +35% (Previously +25%)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Enemy Debuffs (Weakened)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Shadowshot\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Incoming PvE damage is now +30% (Previously +35%)\n&gt;   * Incoming PvP damage is now +50% (Previously +55%)\n&gt;   * This effect no longer excludes power weapons\n&gt;* Tractor Cannon (Repulsor Force)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Incoming PvE damage is now +30% for all elements (Previously +33%/50% for Non-Void/Void damage respectively)\n&gt;   * Incoming PvP damage is now +50% for all elements (Previously +33%/50% for Non-Void/Void damage respectively)\n&gt;* Hammer Strike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Incoming PvE damage is now +30% (Previously +50%)\n&gt;   * Duration increased from 6 to 10 seconds in PvE\n&gt;* Shattering Strike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Incoming PvE damage is now +30% (Previously +50%)\n&gt;   * Duration increased from 6 to 10 seconds in PvE\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Reduced Super Damage Resistance**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Goal:** Since the launch of *Destiny 2* we have slowly introduced buffs to supers, especially roaming supers. While we believe supers should be powerful they should not be mindless. We want supers to be more risky in both PvE and PvP. We want players to think about positioning and timing more. Not so long ago we experimented with Spectral Blades by lowering the damage resistance substantially. These changes were generally well received and improved the experience of the super for both the person running it and the person who was running from it. In PvE players shouldn\u2019t feel like their super makes them invulnerable and casting one should call for situational strategic thinking. In PvP players need to feel like they can challenge a super and that with skillful play there\u2019s a chance they can beat it.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Super Damage Resistance removed from masterwork armor\n&gt;* Inherent Super Damage Resistance lowered by category (see below)**Low- 54% \u2192 49%**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Nova Fission\n&gt;* Thunder Crash\n&gt;* Blade Barrage\n&gt;* Nova Bomb\n&gt;* Well of Radiance\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Medium - 56% \u2192 51%**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Hammer of Sol\n&gt;* Daybreak\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**High - 60% \u2192 53%**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Fist of Havok\n&gt;* Burning Maul\n&gt;* Sentinel Shield\n&gt;* Arc Staff\n&gt;* Arc Lightning\n&gt;* Shadowshot\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Other (unchanged)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Spectral Blades - 52% / 54.4%\n&gt;* Golden Gun - 0%\n&gt;* Chaos Reach - 40%\n\n\nNext week, we\u2019ll be taking a look at how your arsenal of weaponry will be changing.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Add to Your Collection\n\nOver the weekend, we were boots on the ground at PAX West.

He\u2019s been texting me every day, making sure I\u2019m all right\u2014but I have to say that I\u2019m going a little crazy. It was nice to see him at PAX, but it just wasn\u2019t enough time. Wait a second, this is a Movie of the Week intro, not my personal diary. Let\u2019s look at what\u2019s hot on the creations page this week!\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Once Upon a Time in the Reef**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T8Mhjq0In4)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Ricochet Rounds + Sniper = Profit**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxRIkhq0f08)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to put your name in the hat for Movie of the Week, make sure to post your content to the [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) on bungie.net, or throw a video to [myself ](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04)or [Cozmo ](https://twitter.com/Cozmo23)on Twitter.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a candle burning at both ends right now. *Shadowkeep* is so close. SO CLOSE! I can\u2019t wait to get back on that lunar surface with you all. See you next week when we talk about some exciting Sandbox weapon changes, like Sunshot having 12 in the mag, or Graviton Lance getting a 30% PvE damage increase\u2026\n\n\nThanks for stopping by.

Leaves will soon change color, and the evenings will get cooler with each passing day. October 1 is just a few quick weeks away, but we have an Expo to attend this weekend\u2014and much more to share with you before launch.\n\n\nEarlier today, we published an article to shed some light on our [new approach to Seasons in Year 3 of *Destiny 2*](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48097). Game Director Luke Smith almost broke his keyboard again dishing out the details on our upcoming Season Pass, the Seasonal Artifact, and more lessons from the last year of *Destiny 2*.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126871/undying_artifact_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GOjeWiO.jpg)\n\n\nShadowkeep kicks off a whole new year of *Destiny* updates. We hope you\u2019ll come along with us every step of the way.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Destination: PAX West\n\nEvery summer, we find ourselves traveling the world to talk about *Destiny*. At the end of that journey, right before a *Destiny* launch, we make a final stop in our own backyard. We wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. PAX West holds a special place in our hearts. It\u2019s the show where more developers from Bungie get to interact with the people who play their games than any other.\n\n\nThis year, our booth is a chance for you to visit Widow\u2019s Court again. Risk/Reward matches are making a return to 48 gameplay stations. If you didn\u2019t attend GuardianCon earlier this year, here\u2019s the lowdown on how you can earn some convention-exclusive loot to prove that you were not only there, but you emerged victorious from a re-imagined field of battle:\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126890/16x9_RiskReward.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/5K8kHAo.jpg)\n\n\n**Reward Matches**\n\nPlay a round of 6v6 Control to earn an exclusive PAX West edition of the Drifter Coin. Win or lose, you\u2019ll earn this reward. You\u2019re more than welcome to pass through the line as many times as you\u2019d like to collect these coins for you, your friends, or even a fellow Guardian that you meet at the event!\n\n\n**Risk Matches**\n\nIf you\u2019d like to earn something a little more flashy, you can spend one of your coins to commit yourself to a round of 3v3 Elimination. If you win, you\u2019ll receive an exclusive Crucible pin, available only at PAX West 2019.\n\n\n**Bungie Store**\n\nWe\u2019ll also have some goodies for purchase, without the intrigue of combat. The Bungie Store is coming to PAX in full force. This is your opportunity to grab some Shadowkeep loot before it becomes available [online](https://bungiestore.com/). Our away team will even stock some PAX-exclusive items, available only to those who attend!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126890/16x9_Menu_with_callouts.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vLhrGFb.jpg)\n\n\n**Meet the Devs**\n\nOne of the things we enjoy most about events is giving you the opportunities to meet the developers of *Destiny*. Through the entire weekend, our booth will be fully staffed with people from various disciplines. We\u2019ll also have book signings and general meet-and-greets with the developers, so stay tuned to @Bungie for announcements of availability!\n\n\n**Propsmith**\n\n[Aurum Effects](https://twitter.com/AurumEffects) returns to the Bungie booth showcasing various weapon builds from the history of *Destiny*. Stop by to meet [Eric Newguard](https://twitter.com/RatedEforEric) and Derek Rosengrant to learn about his craft.\n\n\n**Community Cosplay Meetup**\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be PAX without cosplay, now would it? Each year, members of our community rally together to host a cosplay meetup, which also serves as a general meet-and-greet for any member of the community to attend.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**When:** Sunday, September 1, 1:30\u20132:30 PM PDT\n&gt;\n&gt;**Where:** Freeway Park, behind the convention center\n&gt;\n&gt;**Event Facebook Page:** [RSVP here if you\u2019re planning to come!](https://www.facebook.com/events/559591874573376/)\n\n\nWe have a lot going on.

Destiny Player Support has a full rundown prepared, giving you dates and times for our maintenance window so you don\u2019t miss a thing.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;***Destiny 2* Hotfix 2.5.2.2**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next week, Hotfix 2.5.2.2 will become available to players in *Destiny 2*. This hotfix makes several targeted quality-of-life improvements to the *Destiny 2* experience, including changes to the quests for the [Wendigo GL3](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/578459533) and The [Mountaintop pinnacle](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/3993415705) Grenade Launchers.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For deployment times when they are available, follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help). For the full 2.5.2.2 patch notes as soon as they are available, stay tuned to our [Updates](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Category?category=Updates) page.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who observe issues during any maintenance window should report to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Preparing for PC Migration**\n&gt;\n&gt;With the launches of Shadowkeep and New Light on October 1, *Destiny 2* on PC is migrating from Battle.net to Steam. Players who want to prepare their account for this upcoming migration should visit our [PC Move](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove) page to get started.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;PC players who link a Steam account to their bungie.net profile will be fully prepared to have their Guardians, game licenses, and Silver transferred to their Steam account on October 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Battle.net Purchases\u2014September 3**\n&gt;\n&gt;On September 3, *Destiny 2* game content and *Destiny 2* Silver will no longer be available for purchase on the Battle.net shop.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;PC players who wish to play *Destiny 2* before October 1 have until the September 3 deadline to make their purchase on Battle.net. From that point on, *Destiny 2* game purchases for PC will be available only from the Steam Store [product page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085660/Destiny_2/).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Forsaken Character Boosts\u2014September 3**\n&gt;\n&gt;Also on September 3, *Destiny 2: Forsaken* character boosts will no longer be available for purchase on any platform.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On October 1, players who wish to accelerate their *Destiny 2* experience straight into the end game will find that all characters (new and old) are auto-levelled to 750 Power. Paired with the optimized new player experience in New Light, players will be able to jump into endgame activities faster than ever.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information, please see our [New Light](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight) page.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Reeling for More\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/g9DdZYr.gif)\n\n\nEven though the heat of the summer is winding down, it\u2019s still nice to hide away in an air-conditioned movie theater to escape the power of the day star. Grab a refreshing drink, and check these movies out:\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Mr. Fahrenheit**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/jKBhlgoCXow)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: I\u2019ve never cared so much about the life of a Sparrow until this video**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/qrHNzUv723c)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to put your name in the hat for Movie of the Week, make sure to post your content to the [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) on bungie.net, or throw a video to [myself](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04) or [Cozmo](https://twitter.com/Cozmo23) on Twitter.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty obvious that PAX West is something special to many of us here. Ten years ago was my first, but I remember it like it was yesterday. Meeting my clan for the first time, walking through the halls to get hands on with many of the games I was excited to play in the fall. I had the opportunity to meet folks from Bungie for the first time, which led to a dream to work here someday. This event can spark a lifetime of friendship, or a set of goals that leads to your future career. Hopefully we\u2019ll see you around the Bungie booth for some Crucible action. Maybe we\u2019ll bump into each other on the mean streets of Seattle after hours, too.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think about next week when we have an action-packed weekend, but the Mars community challenge is almost here. I\u2019ve seen some players placing bets on how quickly the community will complete the objectives. I\u2019m not a betting man, but I believe in you all.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126890/Mars_Community_Challenge.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SOAr7TS.jpg)\n\n\nGood luck, and see you out there.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nDmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1061024, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 8/29/2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567194397, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cx5ul9/this_week_at_bungie_8292019/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collections": [{"author_id": "t2_mocx5", "author_name": "DTG_Bot", "collection_id": "3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "created_at_utc": 1565530291.728, "description": "A list of all This Week At Bungie posts.", "display_layout": null, "last_update_utc": 1566511559.524, "link_ids": ["t3_af25cd", "t3_ah481q", "t3_ajsedl", "t3_alvfka", "t3_ao9wte", "t3_aqpxzn", "t3_at9ul5", "t3_avx91v", "t3_ayk8tz", "t3_b15gjp", "t3_b3wyr2", "t3_b6obl3", "t3_b9k4wk", "t3_bc5jkp", "t3_besokf", "t3_bhe8w9", "t3_bk1cnt", "t3_bmpymm", "t3_bpj5x6", "t3_bs9s8g", "t3_buzcp4", "t3_bxmngp", "t3_c0c9sb", "t3_c311of", "t3_c6bun6", "t3_cc0flf", "t3_cez1le", "t3_chufi1", "t3_ckuatg", "t3_cnreiv", "t3_cqwvcm", "t3_cu4h82"], "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/collection/3c574ed8-cf33-4caa-a029-e933c9bc4a71", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "title": "This Week At Bungie"}], "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566511559, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cu4h82/this_week_at_bungie_8222019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cu4h82", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 804, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cu4h82/this_week_at_bungie_8222019/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1566511564, "score": 862, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48088\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we broke down a barrier.\n\n\nOver the last few months, we\u2019ve been talking about the future of the *Destiny* franchise. From the ViDoc to the recently released Director\u2019s Cut articles ([Parts I](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48058), [II](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48064), and [III](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48072)), we\u2019ve unraveled a map and plotted a course for our future. This week, we took one of our bigger steps with [Cross Save](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave).\n\n\nFor many of us, this is one of the most exciting pieces of the puzzle. Our teams have been hard at work to bring this feature to *Destiny 2* and enable you to play with your friends, no matter which platform they call home. We\u2019ve already started seeing reunions throughout the community on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. If you haven\u2019t shared your story yet, let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bungie) or the [forums](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=Destiny2). Who are you most excited to fight the Darkness with, now that Cross Save is live?\n\n\nThis week was indeed a busy one, as we\u2019ve also deployed an away team to gamescom in Germany, to dish out some new details on *Shadowkeep* and Season of the Undying. If you missed the news, be sure to check out the videos below!\n\n\n**Inside Xbox: Finishers**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/ElofWZR1KKg)\n\n\n***Shadowkeep* gamescom trailer**\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MspAKr8THf4)\n\n\n**Season of the Undying trailer**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/G8mC5GaDoyQ)\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s look to our immediate future. We\u2019ve begun preparations for the PC move to Steam, and we have some live game calendar updates to discuss.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##The Great Migration\n\nThis week, we also began the transition of *Destiny 2* to Steam. Players can now begin to prepare for the launch of *Shadowkeep* by linking their Steam and Battle.net accounts using the [Bungie.net/PCMove portal](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove), with *Destiny 2* becoming available on Steam starting October 1. This will ensure that all of your Guardians, Gear, Game ownership and Silver will be available at *Shadowkeep* launch.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0LWcq4KHxu4)\n\n\n**NOTE:** As we prepare to transition *Destiny 2* to Steam, your last chance to purchase *Destiny 2*, any expansions, or Silver on Battle.net is September 3, 2019. Additionally, players may pre-order *Destiny 2: Shadowkeep* on Steam, but will not be able to play until October 1. Additionally, players may begin to purchase Silver on Steam starting October 1.\n\n\nWith Season of Opulence coming to a close, we wanted to make sure you had ample time to get into the action with your friends on PC and got proper warning before your favorite Eververse items went on hiatus. Make sure to grab Silver before September 3, so you don\u2019t miss your final chances to snag some community favorites:\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126668/MTX_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NokXC1F.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Iron and Valor\n\nNext week begins your final month of the Season of Opulence. Lord Saladin returns with the power-enabled combat of the Iron Banner.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125945/Calendar_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/A9wO6m9.jpg)\n\n\n**Start: August 27, 10 AM PDT**\n\n**End: September 3, 10 AM PDT**\n\n\nIncreased Valor also returns, so if you\u2019re hunting for those final resets required for the Redrix\u2019s Broadsword quest, this is the perfect time to jump in. Moments of Triumph has also been extended through September 17, so this may help you earn the Crucible pinnacle weapon that\u2019s been holding you back from the \u201cMMXIX\u201d title.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##September Community Challenge: Mars\n\nWhether we wanted it or not, we\u2019ve stepped into a war with the Hive on Mars. So let\u2019s get to taking out their\u2026 wait a second, this isn\u2019t what I meant to start with.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126668/Mars_Image_2.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/FuiKKNG.jpg)\n\n\nWith a bit of extra time before *Shadowkeep* ships, we thought it would be a good idea to get the community in fighting shape to return to the Moon. Not just you, but the entire community. What better way to focus your attention on the Hive than to challenge you in the ways of old? As we have a Quality of Life update coming on September 3 that touches some Mars content, why not double down and maybe help a few aspiring Wayfarers along the way\u2026.\n\n\n**Start: September 3, 10 AM PDT\u00a0**\n\n**End: September 10, 10 AM PDT**\n\n\nCommunity Objectives:\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Defeat 175 thousand Wave 7 Escalation Protocol bosses\u00a0\n* Defeat 300 million Hive on Mars\u00a0\n* Mars Nightfalls\n\n\n   * Defeat Nokris 150 thousand times\n   * Defeat Xol 100 thousand times\n* Use 300 thousand Override Frequencies\n\n\n**Rewards:**\n\nNow, this wouldn\u2019t be interesting without rewards. If all objectives are completed during the event, any player to complete at least one Nightfall will be granted a unique emblem, granted to only those who rose to the Mars challenge.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126668/Lost_City_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SYckwjL.jpg)\n\n\nThis also serves as an opportunity for you to further impress Emperor Calus. If the community reaches all the above goals, Calus will unlock additional rewards for successful Menagerie completions. Starting when goals are met, players will be guaranteed two rewards when slotting their runes and opening the chest, and an additional reward will be added each Friday for the remainder of the Season.\n\n\nGood luck, Guardians. We\u2019ll be watching.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Keeping It Clean\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126139/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/4dmDvDY.gif)\n\n\nFor every deployment, there\u2019s a risk that wires may get crossed or things may fall out of place. Destiny Player Support has been holding the line in the face of cross save and PC migration, ensuring FAQs and need-to-knows are available for your consumption. Now that both of these features are live, they have updates.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Steam Linking and Cross Save**\n&gt;\n&gt;This week, Steam Linking and Cross Save went live for all *Destiny 2* players on Bungie.net.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Steam Linking is a preparatory step for PC players for when *Destiny 2* moves to Steam this fall, and is required before PC players can enable Cross Save. To initiate Steam Linking, please visit our [PC Move](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove) page.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Cross Save allows players to bring their preferred set of Guardians with them across all supported platforms in *Destiny 2*. To enable Cross Save, please visit our [Cross Save page](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Cross Save: 90-Day Waiting Period**\n&gt;\n&gt;As we\u2019ve mentioned in past weeks, players who disable Cross Save will encounter a 90-day waiting period before Cross Save can be re-enabled. This is a security feature that safeguards players from a number of worst-case scenarios.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In addition to disabling Cross Save, any of the following actions will also result in a waiting period where Cross Save cannot be enabled or disabled:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Players who purchase Silver cannot disable Cross Save until 90 days after the Silver was purchased\n&gt;* Players who perform a refund for purchased Silver through a platform storefront cannot activate Cross Save until that Silver is re-purchased for that account\n&gt;* Players subject to a ban or restriction cannot activate Cross Save, or disable Cross Save if it is already active, until that ban or restriction has expired\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This information has been added to our updated [Cross Save FAQ](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who encounter other issues with Cross Save are encouraged to report to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Solstice of Heroes Ending Soon**\n&gt;\n&gt;This week is the final week for players to participate in Solstice of Heroes 2019.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;At the weekly reset next Tuesday, August 27, Solstice of Heroes will end and the European Aerial Zone will no longer be accessible. Additionally, players will no longer be able to upgrade their Uncommon (Drained) or Rare (Renewed) Solstice of Heroes armor sets.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who have unlocked the Legendary (Majestic) armor sets may continue to complete objectives and masterwork their armor after Solstice of Heroes concludes. For those of you who missed Shattered Throne last time it was available, it will be returning on August 27.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Popcorn: Butter, Cheese, or Chocolate?\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/TtYM7bU.gif)\n\n\nSure is lonely here in the Community pod. With DeeJ in Germany for gamescom and Cozmo on diaper duty, it\u2019s a rough life. I brought in donuts on Wednesday, and I had to eat half the box all by myself. At least Griffin was here to finish the other half. As we sat eating our lonely donuts, we came across a few awesome MOTW contenders. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got this week:\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Live Action**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/weCRuvgWjSI)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Heroically Whispering\u2026 with speed!**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/ZuqNr5YXm78)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to put your name in the hat for Movie of the Week, make sure to post your content to the [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) on bungie.net, or throw a video to [myself](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04) or [Cozmo](https://twitter.com/Cozmo23) on Twitter.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nWhat a wonderful week. I'm excited for the weekend but greatly enjoyed watching the community chatter as we entered the final week of Solstice. I\u2019m on the final stretch for my Legendary armor, with just a few objectives left on my Warlock to complete. Final stop: EAZ. The question is, where will you find me? Xbox One, PlayStation 4, or PC?\n\n\n**[Community Art: Aviixe: EAZ Freefall](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Detail?itemId=253198928)**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126668/Solstice_CommArt.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ScexXnK.jpg)\n\n\nProbably going to play on all three this weekend, thanks to cross save.

This week, we\u2019ve done something different. We won\u2019t be picking each of these apart here in the TWAB, but rather directing your attention to where this information lives. Here\u2019s the rundown:\n\n\n**[Director\u2019s Cut: Part 1 \u2013 Looking Back](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48058)**\n\nLuke explores the learnings of *Destiny 2* Year 2 and the Annual Pass: what went well, what didn\u2019t, and what we\u2019ve learned. This is a bit of a read, so make sure to have some snacks before you start.\n\n\n**[Director\u2019s Cut: Part 2 \u2013 The Care and Feeding of the RPG](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48064)**\n\nThis morning, Luke went a bit deeper on what the live stream covered, providing additional context for how you will transition from the armor you wear now to Armor 2.0 in the Fall. Additionally, he covered how the ways you acquire Power will change and how *New Light* will introduce players to the Power system in October.\n\n\n**(Coming Soon) Director\u2019s Cut: Part 3 \u2013 Combat: The Inevitable Collision of Action and RPG**\n\nTomorrow, we take a hard look at damage. *Shadowkeep* will bring many changes to buffs, debuffs, stacking, Supers, and more.\n\n\nWe\u2019re sure you have questions\u2014and that you\u2019ll have even more after tomorrow\u2019s final entry to the Director\u2019s Cut series. We\u2019ll be looking to answer as many as possible as we approach October 1. Sound off with what you\u2019d like to hear more about, and feel free to ask about any of the finer details.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Dresstiny\n\nWhile Luke was burning up the keyboard, DeeJ took to the streams to host members of the development team in exploring new elements of customization coming with Armor 2.0 in *Shadowkeep*. Stats, mods, appearance, and more were discussed throughout the stream.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://player.twitch.tv/?autoplay=false&amp;video=v467144685)[Watch Armor Customization Preview - Wednesday 8/14 @ 10am Pacific from Bungie on www.twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/467144685?tt_content=text_link&amp;tt_medium=vod_embed)\n\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to be excited for *Shadowkeep*. Quality-of-life updates, overhauls to investment systems, and new ways to fine-tune your monster-killing machine. Of all the customization options coming with Armor 2.0, I\u2019m most excited to rock my favorite Titan gauntlets once more, decked out with various mods to complement my playstyle. Shaxx always tells me to throw more grenades, but I sure do love shoulder charging people into oblivion.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126430/JB_Titan_Shoulder_Charge.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bD5roVz.jpg)\n\n\nDiscipline, strength, and resilience are on my mind. Intellect? Bah. I don\u2019t need the help. I\u2019ll make my own Supers with my knee. That said, efficiency is only half the battle. *Destiny* is also about fashion. Some even call it Dresstiny from time to time. Starting in *Shadowkeep*, we\u2019ll be celebrating those among you with a keen eye for style with a new Community emblem.\n\n\n**The Levante Prize\u00a0\u00a0**\n\nThe most prestigious fashion prize. Awarded in honor of the original Guardian Outfitter, Eva Levante.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126430/Fashion_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sdiCwnr.jpg)\n\n\n\"When I was young, the Last City would celebrate looking fashionable for a whole week. Seeing that tradition come back brings me such joy. It\u2019s my honor to grant you the first Levante prize of a new fashionable era.\" \u2014Eva Levante\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nEach month, we\u2019ll host a fashion show of sorts, and winners will earn this sweet emblem. I personally can\u2019t wait to see how you all customize your guardians, mixing and matching various sets with an assortment of shaders.

Next Wednesday, August 21, Cross Save will become available to all players of *Destiny 2*. We\u2019ve been doing some testing on our side to ensure a smooth launch, but Destiny Player Support has some last minute details to set you up for success.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Safeguarding Your Steam Account**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Tuesday, August 20, Steam linking is scheduled to go live for all players on Bungie.net.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Steam linking is the first step for PC players to [migrate](http://C:\\Users\\ddague\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.Outlook\\SINQZNFH\\bungie.net\\PCMove) their *Destiny 2* accounts from Battle.net later this year and is required before players with linked PC accounts can activate cross save.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Because account security is vital, we strongly encourage players to setup Steam Guard two-factor authentication. For a comprehensive guide on setting up **Steam Guard** on your mobile device, please visit Steam\u2019s [support page](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4440-RTUI-9218).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information on securing your *Destiny* account, please see our [Account Security Guide](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/12718).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Cross Save: August vs. October**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Wednesday, August 21, [cross save](https://www.bungie.net/CrossSave) is scheduled to become available for all *Destiny 2* players on Bungie.net.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Before this feature goes live, we\u2019d like to set expectations on how the cross save experience will evolve following the launches of *New Light* and *Shadowkeep* on October 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Expansion Destinations and Activities\n&gt;\n&gt;When cross save launches on August 21, cross-save-enabled players will not be able to access expansion destinations or activities from platforms where they do not own that expansion license until the corresponding expansion is purchased on that platform.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**For example:** A cross-save-enabled player who owns Forsaken on their Xbox One account, but not on PlayStation 4, will not be able to launch into the Dreaming City on PlayStation 4 when cross saving their Xbox One characters.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With the arrival of *New Light* on October 1, we\u2019re changing how players access destinations and activities for content that they do not own. For more information on *New Light*, please see our *New Light* page.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Powerful Rewards\n&gt;\n&gt;When cross save launches on August 21, cross-save-enabled players who earn gear on platforms where they **do not** own Forsaken will receive that gear at below-Forsaken Power levels until Forsaken is purchased on that platform.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**For example:** A cross-save-enabled player on a 750 Power character who owns Forsaken on their Xbox One account, but not on PlayStation 4, will receive all powerful gear drops at 380 Power when earned on PlayStation 4 while cross saving their Xbox One characters.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;These Power restrictions will be removed in Update 2.6.0 with the launches of *New Light* and *Shadowkeep* later this year.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information on cross save, please visit: [Bungie.net/CrossSave](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##It\u2019s\u2026\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/EHM283U.gif)\n\n\nThis week, our winners will not be assisting you on how to recognize different types of Guardians from quite a long way away. They\u2019ll be referencing some cheeky jokes, new and old. Hopefully this week, we have content for the whole family\u2014even those pesky kids who keep telling me to \u201cYeet this Wheat.\u201d\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: The Round(ish) Table**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/UxZ7xYZTgKI)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Get Ready to Drop**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/c03ZFragDvY)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to put your name in the hat for Movie of the Week, make sure to post your content to the [Community Creations](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) page on bungie.net, or throw a video to [myself](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04) or [Cozmo](https://twitter.com/Cozmo23) on Twitter.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a wrap! Well, sort of. We\u2019ll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for Part 3 of the Director\u2019s Cut. Seeing as though I just got a Crucible tattoo, I\u2019m excited to hear your thoughts on the details that Luke will be sharing.

Right now, let\u2019s focus on the ways we\u2019ll be able to decide where you'll play.\n\nTwo important updates just went live with this article:\n\n#www.bungie.net/pcmove\nThis is a resource for players who have been playing Destiny 2 on PC and will be moving with us to our new home on Steam. In keeping with the announcement from last week about our new launch window, Destiny 2 will arrive on Steam for the first time on October 1. Before that happens, on August 20, you\u2019ll be invited to begin the process of linking your PC player accounts for a smooth transition of your Guardians and all your game purchases.\n\n#www.bungie.net/crosssave\nThis is a resource for players who know they\u2019ll be playing Destiny 2 in more than one place this Fall. Cross Save will finally let us unify our adventures across many platforms. The launch of Cross Save is planned for August 21. Before that happens, check out the new information we\u2019re serving up about how it will work and what you'll be able to bring with you. If you\u2019ve been nurturing Guardians on more than one account, you\u2019ll have some choices to make.\n\n---\n\n#PAVING THE ROAD TO LAUNCH\nPlayers of Destiny have a lot of [questions](https://twitter.com/DeeJ_BNG/status/1159114417776160769) about Shadowkeep. We wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, because we have a lot to tell you between now and launch. This is more than a Moon mission. We\u2019re kicking off a whole new year of play, with some interesting evolutions for the experience. Without assigning exact dates to each moment, here is a sequence of events (in the order they will occur) that will broaden your understanding of what you\u2019ll be playing in October:\n\n1. '(Director's Cut)[https://twitter.com/thislukesmith/status/1156972804064985089]' with Luke Smith\n2. Armor Customization Preview livestream\n3. More Shadowkeep details at gamescom\n4. Cross Save launch\n5. How Seasons will change in D2Y3\n6. PVP reveal for Shadowkeep\n7. An invitation to the Crucible at PAX\n\nAnd the rest will be packed into the last mile, during September. Those are the big-ticket items that we plan to cover in depth, but it\u2019s not the full list of everything we\u2019ll talk about. We\u2019ll hear from Luke a number of times as we tackle these topics, beginning early next week. Thanks for going on the journey with us.\n\nWatch this space.\n\n---\n\n#MOD SQUAD\nMany of you have asked us to elaborate on what we\u2019ve referred to as \u201cArmor 2.0.\u201d\n\nNext week, we\u2019ll do just that \u2013 and we\u2019ll do it live! \n\nArmor Customization Preview Livestream\n-or-\nBuilding a Better Monster Killing Machine\n\nAugust 14, 2019 \u2013 10AM Pacific\nwww.twitch.tv/bungie\nwww.youtube.com/bungie\nwww.mixer.com/bungie\n\n[Image/Gif Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126139/Armor_Customization_Stream.gif)\n\nTune in wherever you feel most at home to watch three developers from Bungie build their ideal Titan, Hunter, or Warlock.

Have you tricked out your dress uniform yet? One of the mission parameters is to defeat 100 Minibosses. Some of you have expressed that this is a few too many Boss Fights. Upon further analysis, we have agreed.\n\nThe total expectation is being revised down, from 100 to 50. The change goes live next week. If you have been struggling to hit this milestone, help is on the way. If you already hit it, please go easy on your fellow Guardians who pleaded for mercy.\n\nNow we come to the part where I pass the mic to our Player Support Team to provide a more in-depth tactical briefing on how we deploy bits to your video game machine.\n\n---\n\n#PLAYER SUPPORT REPORT\nOn the Bungie.net [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help&amp;tSort=3&amp;tType=0&amp;d=0&amp;lang=en), an intrepid band of problem solvers are devoted to bringing order out of chaos.

Hotfix 2.5.2.1 will begin rolling out across all platforms and regions.\n* 11:00 AM PDT (1800 UTC): Destiny 2 maintenance is expected to conclude.\n\nFollowing the [recent announcement](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48032) that Destiny 2: Shadowkeep will launch on October 1, 2019, Hotfix 2.5.2.1 brings with it some changes to the game experience that will allow us to extend the content calendar for Season of Opulence. Additionally, we\u2019re taking this opportunity to refine the grind for Solstice of Heroes, which you can read more about below.\n\nFor live updates on this hotfix as it rolls out to players, follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed on help.bungie.net.\n\n**Solstice of Heroes: 100 Mini Bosses**\n\nFor next week\u2019s hotfix, we re-evaluated the objective requirements for unlocking the Majestic Solstice armor sets. Specifically among these objectives, we believe the 100 Mini Boss challenge has the most room for improvement. Here are the changes we\u2019re making:\n\n* This objective is being scaled down from 100 Mini Bosses defeated to 50\n* Completing the final boss round contributes an additional 5 points of progress\n\nIf you\u2019ve already earned points toward this objective, you\u2019ll find your progress intact once Hotfix 2.5.2.1 is deployed. Happy hunting.\n\n**Known Issues Callout: Granted Emblems in Collections**\nLast week we distributed the Prismatic Inferno and Wolves Unleashed emblems to the Postmasters of eligible players in Destiny 2. Since then, we have worked to make players aware of a known issue where these emblems do not appear in the Collection.\n\nNext week, with the deployment of Hotfix 2.5.2.1, these emblems will correctly appear in the Emblem Collection and can be reclaimed by players who own them. For the full Hotfix 2.5.2.1 patch notes as soon as they are available, players should stay tuned to our Updates page.\n\n**Retiring Refer-a-Friend**\nWith the upcoming launch of Cross Save, we\u2019re making significant changes to how Bungie.net identifies player licenses in Destiny 2.\n\nAs a result of these changes, Refer-a-Friend will no longer be available following the launch of Cross Save on August 21, 2019. Until then, all players who wish to participate in Refer-a-Friend should do so as soon as possible.\n\nFor veteran players looking for the right opportunity to make Guardians out of their closest friends after Refer-a-Friend goes away, Destiny 2: New Light launches later this year and is free for all players on all available platforms.\n\n---\n\n#ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WILD\nMovie of the Week is among our most cherished traditions as a community. You make videos. We watch them. Our most favorites are celebrated here, with an Emblem and some bragging rights to be claimed. This week, I got to pick, with the help of a kid on my street, so let the creative tyranny run free!\n\nMovie of the Week: Elevate [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfCpwtfQvVk)\n\n\nHonorable Mention: Butt Was Clenched [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KggEdI0Mfw0)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to put your name in the hat for Movie of the Week, make sure to post your content to the [Community Creations](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) page on Bungie.net, or hit up your friendly neighborhood community managers on Twitter.\n\n\n---\n\nIt was nice to spend this time with you again, constant reader. If you\u2019ve been following the ongoing saga of \u201cThis Week At Bungie,\u201d you know that Cozmo has another little light that needs swaddlin\u2019 and Dylan is observing a wedding. This is why you were stuck with me. I miss them so very badly. They are my conscience \u2013 my counterbalance \u2013 my reality check. Lonely as this week may have been, it was refreshing to have the freedom to explore some new ideas for how to manage a community all by myself. If you see them out there in the wild, remind them to turn off their phone. They\u2019ve earned a break from the action.\n\nCome check us out on our stream next week! There is no telling what may happen.\n\nDeeJ, out.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1028871, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 8/8/2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565732186, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cnreiv/this_week_at_bungie_882019/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564693434, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ckuatg/this_week_at_bungie_812019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ckuatg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1001, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ckuatg/this_week_at_bungie_812019/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1564693435, "score": 1106, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48036\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we\u2019re taking the time to get it right.\n\n\nIf you missed the [announcement earlier today](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48032), *Destiny 2: Shadowkeep* and *New Light* have new launch dates.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Luke and Mark**: As we\u2019ve been getting closer and closer to serving up *Shadowkeep* and *New Light*, it has become increasingly clear to us that our releases for this Fall would benefit from a bit more time in the oven.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Being independent means that the future of Destiny 2 is entirely on our team. It also means that we\u2019re agile enough to choose to do what\u2019s best for the game and our players, even if it\u2019s the hard choice.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We wanted to let you\u2014our community\u2014be the first to know that we\u2019re changing the date for *Shadowkeep* and *New Light* from September 17 to October 1.\n\n\nFor full details on the change, make sure to check out the [New Launch Window](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48032) article.

We\u2019ll be watching to see who among you earns all three armor sets and unlocks the coveted Voidstreak Sparrow.\n\n\nSome of you might argue that there\u2019s a better Sparrow available\u2026\n\n\n&gt;[Shaxx has been acting a little weird since Mara left](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/cjpn1x/shaxx_has_been_acting_a_little_weird_since_mara/) from [r/destiny2](http://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2)\n\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Ending on a High Note\n\nWith two more weeks on our Season of Opulence Calendar, we\u2019re taking an opportunity to make players feel truly Opulent. Moments of Triumph is being extended for those hunting their prize ship, Sparrow, and T-shirt. Multiple Iron Banners will happen during the final month and a few Valor/Infamy boosts to help Guardians reach some milestones before the end of the season. Here\u2019s a quick calendar for what we have planned:\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125945/Calendar_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/vqCNEYs.jpg)\n\n\nIn Destiny 2 Update 2.5.2.2, you\u2019ll find a quick quality-of-life update to address some trending feedback from players, specifically concerning rewards. Here\u2019s a preview:\n\n\n* **Moments of Triumph** has been extended through 9/17.\n* **Gambit Prime and Reckoning weapon reward rates** will be highly increased.\n\n\n   * They will also have bad-luck protection to guarantee a drop after a set amount of runs.\n* **Reckoning difficulty** will be tuned to be more welcoming as you hunt for rewards.\n* **BrayTech Schematics** will no longer have a daily lockout and will give better chances toward weapons that players do not own.\n* **Mountaintop and Wendigo GL3** pinnacle quests will become more accessible.\n\n\n   * Specific quest objectives will be tuned based on player feedback\n* There will be multiple weeks of **increased Valor and Infamy** to look forward to in September.\n\n\n   * Iron Banner will be accompanied by increased Valor in each event.\n* As the season comes to a close, **Menagerie chests** will become more rewarding as Calus sees fit.\n* On the week of Destiny 2 Update 2.5.2.2, we'll be hosting a **Community Challenge** of sorts. Stay tuned for more details.\n\n\n**Note:**\u00a0While Moments of Triumph has been extended, Solstice of Heroes will end on **August 27**. If you wish to complete all Moments of Triumph, be sure to earn your Legendary Solstice set and Masterwork one piece before that deadline.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll have more specifics on these notes as we get closer, but we wanted to give you a few things to look forward to as we embark on the final sprint toward our Fall releases on October 1.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##What\u2019s Cookin\u2019?\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125346/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KwkVJBm.gif)\n\n\nAnother week, another update. Destiny Update 2.5.2 is live, and by now you\u2019ve probably installed the patch. Destiny Player Support has been all hands on deck, monitoring for any early event hiccups in Solstice of Heroes.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Known Issue Callout: Solstice Key Fragment Magnets**\n&gt;\n&gt;This week, Solstice of Heroes returned in *Destiny 2*.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Shortly after its launch, we identified an issue where Solstice Key Fragment Magnets were not improving the drop rates of Solstice Key Fragments. To mitigate further impact from this issue, we removed this item from the Eververse Trading Co. storefront and disabled its use in players\u2019 inventories.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As we investigate this issue, we are also working on a plan to restore Bright Dust to affected players. We will follow up with more information at a later date.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Prismatic Inferno and Wolves Unleashed Emblems**\n&gt;\n&gt;Earlier today, we distributed the Prismatic Inferno and Wolves Unleashed emblems to the Postmasters of qualifying players in *Destiny 2*.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players should be aware that these emblems will not appear in the Collection until *Destiny 2* has been updated at a later date. Until then, players who want to wear these emblems should keep them handy in their Emblem inventory.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;***Destiny 2* Season of Opulence Known Issues**\n&gt;\n&gt;Listed below are the latest player-impacting issues discovered in Season of Opulence.

Solstice of Heroes is bringing new Moments of Triumph to complete and a new title for Guardians to earn. You\u2019ll also be challenged to upgrade a Solstice of Heroes armor set by completing various objectives throughout *Destiny 2*. If you missed our [Solstice of Heroes 2019 announcement article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48006) yesterday, make sure to check it out. We have a cool trailer to go with it!\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&amp;amp;v=GAdByGfv9xU)\n\n\nIf you have what it takes to fully upgrade your armor set to the Legendary tier, you\u2019ll also find an armor 2.0 version of you Solstice of Heroes set at the Gunsmith when *Shadowkeep* launches.\n\n\nWhile the event begins next week, Lord Saladin didn\u2019t want you sitting idle. The Iron Banner is in full swing, bringing Power-enabled PvP combat back into the fold. If you\u2019re hunting advanced perks on Legendary armor, be sure to complete Saladin\u2019s bounties and quest line. A few changes are coming next week for both that quest and a certain wolf-themed weapon, so let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Commemorative\u00a0\n\nSometimes there are weapons that bring a bit of chaos to the meta. The weekend of Prometheus Lens, otherwise known as \u201cLaser Tag Weekend,\u201d is a great example. Lord of Wolves also falls into this category. Next week, *Destiny 2* Update 2.5.2 will reign in the wolves a bit by reducing the amount of ammo Guardians pick up and toning down the effective range of the weapon. As promised last month, we\u2019ve created an emblem and Triumph for those who braved the wolves during the Season of Opulence. Next week, qualifying players will receive a \u201cLost History\u201d package at the postmaster, which will unlock a unique Triumph. Once the Triumph is claimed, the emblem will be granted.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125811/The_Wolves_Unleashed.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2j8dQHy.jpg)\n\n\nTo qualify for the \u201cWolves Unleashed\u201d emblem, players must have finished an Iron Banner match between 10 AM PDT June 18 and 10 AM PDT June 25 2019 or between 10 AM PDT July 23 and 10 AM PDT July 30 2019.\n\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve created an emblem for those who embraced the madness back in 2017, when skulls were melted during the reign of Prometheus Lens.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125811/Prismatic_Inferno_emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lJ5SPJ1.jpg)\n\n\nTo qualify for the \u201cPrismatic Inferno\u201d emblem, players must have finished a Crucible match between 10 AM PST December 8 and 10 AM PST December 12 2017.\n\n\nWhile we don\u2019t intend for these chaotic micro-events to happen, it can be an exciting time when things get a little crazy. We hope these emblems bring fond memories of the battlefield. Who knows\u2014maybe a new weapon will dominate the Crucible come *Shadowkeep*.

Where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? What you are about to watch probably won\u2019t answer those questions, but they may inspire you to slay an Ahamkara.\n\n\n**MOTW: Solo Riven, but this time only one floor**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/_4lCcHzWtmc)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Rivens\u2019 Last Array**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/oAp8cWOeABI)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to put your name in the hat for Movie of the Week, make sure to post your content to the [Community Creations page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations) on Bungie.net, or throw a video to [myself](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04) or [Cozmo](https://twitter.com/Cozmo23) on Twitter.\n\n\u202f\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThis week, another promise was kept. During the GuardianCon Charity Marathon, one of our donation goal incentives was for me to get a tattoo.\u00a0 Not only did you smash that goal, but you more than doubled it. While I wasn\u2019t surprised, I was more than overjoyed to know that this community was at the ready to donate for the little lights out there. As such, I doubled down on the commitment. Many thanks to our friend [Ingrid](https://www.instagram.com/ingrid_elaine/?hl=en)\u00a0at [Damask Tattoo](https://www.instagram.com/damasktattoo/?hl=en) for helping us to fulfill the goal.\u00a0\n\n\n* [I Made This For You](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1154129067668414465?s=20)\n* [Unbroken](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1154158634022010880?s=20)\n\n\nNow, my eyes turn to Iron Banner. Just have my Hunter to finish the quest on. Saved the best for last, so to speak. Maybe I\u2019ll see you out there before the Solstice of Heroes begins?\n\n\n&gt;Solstice of Heroes [@DestinyTheGame](https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n&gt;\n&gt;4k: [https://t.co/GkfrgwP1ln](https://t.co/GkfrgwP1ln) [pic.twitter.com/R3pOPus1mt](https://t.co/R3pOPus1mt)\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 Joseph Biwald (@JosephBiwald) [July 24, 2019](https://twitter.com/JosephBiwald/status/1154106716369252352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) \n\n\nCheers,\n\nDmg04", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 1008551, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 7/25/2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564179549, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/chufi1/this_week_at_bungie_7252019/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563487798, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cez1le/this_week_at_bungie_7182019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cez1le", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1067, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cez1le/this_week_at_bungie_7182019/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1563487799, "score": 617, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47994\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we make way for the Iron Lord.\n\n\nWe have begun to see Shadows lurking about this season. Many of you have been diligently knocking out every challenge and Triumph for Season of Opulence. Most of us still have a good backlog of Triumphs to complete and items to collect. Someone pointed out that this was the first week of Season of Opulence in which there wasn\u2019t something new to do. Consider this week a chance for you to catch your breath if you have Triumphs and pursuits stacking up. If you\u2019re already looking for more challenges, Solstice of Heroes will heap more of them onto your plate. You\u2019ll find more details on the upcoming event next week.\n\n\n##\n\n***\n\nCry Wolf\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125647/D2_Iron_Banner.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dcczKOH.gif)\n\n\nIt\u2019s time to let the wolves howl again. Saladin will raise his banners next week when he returns to the Tower on July 23. He brings with him an invitation to a powerful fight and accelerated Valor gains.\n\n\n###**Iron Banner and Increased Valor**\n\n**Start: 10 AM PDT on July 23**\n\n**End: 10 AM PDT on July 30**\n\n\nThis competitive event will allow you to advance any Iron Banner quest steps you didn\u2019t finish earlier in the season. If you missed the first Iron Banner of Opulence, this is your chance to kick off the quest and earn that singular gear. Full details on how Iron Banner is being run this season are documented [here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47928). We did get some feedback on this quest and have some changes lined up, but they didn\u2019t make it in time for this Iron Banner. We\u2019ll give you the details before the next one starts up.\n\n\nThis will be the last Iron Banner before we deploy an update to Lord of Wolves. As [Luke mentioned last month](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47948), anyone who plays during these two Iron Banners will receive a special Triumph and emblem to commemorate that you were there when the wolves ran wild.\n\n##\n\n***\n\nA Guardian Always Pays Their Debts\n\n\nAs part of Season of Opulence, Guardians are paying homage to their previous adventures to earn awesome rewards. Some of us leveraged an exploit in the Tribute Hall, taking advantage of Calus\u2019s generosity with some clever character-switching shenanigans to place that free tribute over and over and over\u2026 you get it. This allowed some players to skip the tribute experience entirely, making other players who had done bounties and pledged large amounts of their resource reserves feel a little irked.\n\n\nWe will be fixing this glitch on July 30 as we kick off Solstice of Heroes. As you all know, it not our policy to punish players who discover cheeses, loot caves, or workarounds in the game. If you took advantage of this short cut, you can rest easy. You won\u2019t be marched in front of Calus for sentencing. However, you will not be able to keep using all of your ill-gotten rewards until you square up things with Calus.\u00a0\n\n\nThe \u201cTributes Placed\u201d total will now accurately reflect individual tributes placed on your accounts. If you used the exploit, this number will be updated to properly reflect the total number of tributes you\u2019ve actually placed. The activation and equipping of both the Bad Juju catalyst and \u201cX Marks the Spot\u201d emotes are also gated by your total number of tributes placed. Bad Juju will not require you to have 18 tributes placed for it to be used. If you cheesed your way to the catalyst or emote, you have some time to start placing legit tributes before July 30.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Mysterious Benefactors\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125346/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Clreeon.gif)\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\nPlayer Support has their weekly report on the state of the game and any known issues to watch out for. Here is what you need to know.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;###Tribute Hall Triumphs\u2014Exotic Weapons\n&gt;\n&gt;In [last week\u2019s blog](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47986), we clarified which weapons and armor from the Menagerie contribute to Tribute Hall Triumphs. This week, we\u2019d like to clarify which Exotic weapons provide bonus progress.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;These Exotic weapons include:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* [Legend of Acrius](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/3580904580)\n&gt;* [Tarrabah](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/3110698812)\n&gt;* [Bad Juju](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/2816212794)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players should be aware that [Truth](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/1201830623) does not count toward these Triumphs, and neither does the quest version of Legend of Acrius.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This version of Legend of Acrius can be identified by having no catalyst socket or ornament slot, having only a single round in its magazine, and having the \u201cShock Blast\u201d intrinsic perk. Players with this version of Acrius can upgrade it by completing the Exotic quest that begins with \u201cOn the Comms.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;###**Vital Information: 22/24 Moments of Triumph**\n&gt;\n&gt;With the recent rollout of the 2019 Moments of Triumph, we\u2019d like to clarify a point of confusion which has emerged among players.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Currently, players can complete only 22 of the 24 total Moments of Triumph. The final two Triumphs will become available with the launch of Solstice of Heroes on July 30, 2019. In the meantime, players will be unable to complete this seal and earn the \u201cMMXIX\u201d title.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For more information on Solstice of Heroes 2019, stay tuned to our [News](https://www.bungie.net/en/News) page.\n&gt;\n&gt;###Destiny 2: Season of Opulence Known Issues\n&gt;\n&gt;Listed below are the latest player-impacting issues discovered in Season of Opulence, as reported by players to the [#Help](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help) forum.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* ***Destiny* Services**: We\u2019re investigating an elevation of Destiny service issues over the past week.

In the weeks to come, we\u2019ll dive into many topics that will require some detailed discussion to get you ready for what awaits you this fall. We know you have questions about cross save, *Shadowkeep*, new character customization, Season of the Undying, and things we haven\u2019t even hinted at yet. This summer will be a time to get you ready for another Moon launch.\n\n\nUntil then, enjoy your time in the Iron Banner.\n\n\n**&lt;3 Cozmo**", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 996538, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 7/18/2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563574184, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cez1le/this_week_at_bungie_7182019/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562874957, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cc0flf/this_week_at_bungie_7112019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cc0flf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 453, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cc0flf/this_week_at_bungie_7112019/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1562874958, "score": 546, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47986\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, Calus pays tribute.\n\n\nYou\u2019ve sought the Truth, and found it. You\u2019ve lit your path through darkness with Lumina. Now, Calus is mixing things up a little. In case you\u2019ve been out of the loop, an imperial invitation is waiting for you in the robotic hands of Werner-99 on Nessus. Guardians have been earning a menagerie of loot since the beginning of the season. Now we\u2019re entering a time of celebration. Moments of Triumph and the Tribute Hall became available on Tuesday, each of which commemorate your accomplishments as a Guardian.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Tribute Hall comes with a small price to pay. Calus couldn\u2019t make things too easy for you, now could he? You\u2019re a Guardian after all. As you enter the Tribute Hall, you\u2019re greeted by walls of gold and platforms to place trophies representing your history within Destiny 2. Each trophy requires a sign of your devotion, ranging from an offering of planetary materials to glimmer. Calus offers you four bounties a day to earn discounts for each trophy, so if you\u2019re strapped for Data-Lattice or Bright Dust, you can eventually work your way to a far lower price.\n\n\nAfter placing a few of your trophies, Calus brings a little Bad Juju to the fold\u2026\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CxT0md3CFw)\n\n\nAlongside your hall of tributes, Moments of Triumph are available to complete. While some Triumphs won\u2019t be available until Solstice of Heroes, players can start gaining progress towards the Moments of Triumph 2019 Seal.

Moments like these are refreshing, as many of us started in the same community that we were celebrating throughout the weekend. If you weren\u2019t able to make it to the event, there are recaps of the [Bungie Opening Ceremony](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/450112259) and the [Whisper/Zero Hour Ride Along](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/450115634) available on Twitch.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125554/GC_Cosplay.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/5cUaINn.jpg)\n\n\nWorld First Titles were awarded to representatives of their fireteams. Never call these trophies just \u2018belts\u2019, or Big Show might show up on your doorstep with a few choice words. Guardians also spent some quality time with Eris, and we can\u2019t thank Morla enough for her marathon signing sessions.\n\n\n&gt;Happy Bungie Day!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Still taking it all in. Will have a lot of moments to share over the next few days. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thank you [@bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) &amp; [@guardiancon](https://twitter.com/GuardianCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) &amp; all you beautiful Guardians.

Good games were had and loot was earned. It\u2019s always a blast hosting Crucible matches at events and we loved watching players that had never met before overcoming some pre-formed fireteams. Never underestimate your opponents, no matter how strong the bond with your fireteam may be.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125554/GC2019Day1_098_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dvyLRNL.jpg)\n\n\nWhatever the name is, it\u2019s humbling to know that there\u2019s an event that began with a bunch of Guardians meeting up at a bar to enjoy each other\u2019s company. We\u2019re excited for the future of the [Gaming Community Expo](https://twitter.com/GCXEvent). Maybe we\u2019ll see you there next year.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Blinding the Well\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125346/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3ECqNur.gif)\n\n\nNo matter how much you prepare, a little bug may crawl into your luggage and find itself on a one way trip to the Dreaming City. The Player Support team has been navigating the waters of the #Help forum, gathering information on what players are seeing in the wild since Destiny 2 Update 2.5.1.1 went live.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny 2 Update 2.5.1.1**\n&gt;\n&gt;This week, we deployed Destiny 2 Update 2.5.1.1 to players. Here\u2019s a sampling of issues resolved with this release:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Resolved an issue where players could not activate the Witch\u2019s Vessel in the Crown of Sorrow raid without a team wipe, blocking flawless runs.\n* Resolved an issue blocking the Drifter and Vanguard Allegiance quests from progressing.\n* Resolved an issue where Werner 99-40's weekly bounties no longer gave powerful rewards.\n* Resolved issues where [Sturm ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/2907129556)did not reload non-[Drang](https://www.bungie.net/en/Search?query=drang&amp;type=5) sidearms, and would play reload audio on every kill.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Additionally, as of today\u2019s background maintenance, issues encountered by players in the Blind Well have been resolved. Players who visit the Blind Well in the Dreaming City should be able to spend any-tier Charge of Light to once again initiate this activity.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the full list of changes, please see our [Update 2.5.1.1 Patch Notes](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47978) page.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Vital Information: High Roller Triumph**\n&gt;\n&gt;With the launch of the 2019 Moments of Triumph, we have monitored player confusion regarding the unlock conditions for the High Roller Triumph.

The actual emblem for participating in this fundraiser is the [System of Peace](https://www.bungie.net/en/Search?query=System%20of%20Peace&amp;type=5). To correct this issue, any player whose donation qualifies for this emblem will receive both emblems after July 14.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Just Fight Your Bad Guy\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8Jbkky5.gif)\n\n\nAh, Movie of the Week.

Starting next week, on July 2, you can start pre-ordering the *Destiny Grimoire Anthology, Vol. 2: Fallen Kingdoms* from the Bungie Store. The book will ship in October.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125346/GRIMOIRE.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/u8FqWne.jpg)\n\n\nWe will also be offering a new \u201cConsult the Archives\u201d emote in the Eververse store for all of you lore lovers out there.

Players began to race out of the area and then back to the chest as fast as they could to get as many rewards as possible before sent back to orbit. It felt reminiscent of when players were farming treasure keys from chests on their Sparrows leading up to House of Wolves.\n\n\nConsider this an error in your favor. We haven\u2019t rushed to fix it, but when we patch on July 9, this loophole will officially close, allowing only one opening of the chest per completion. Until then, we invite you take advantage of this all you like. Grow fat with strength.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Charitable Endeavors\n\nLast week, we had the honor in participating in the annual GuardianCon charity marathon. We were overwhelmed by the generosity from players showing up in huge numbers to support a great cause. In our 4-hour block, you raised $406,000 for St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, and the grand total for the week was $3.7 million! Thank you so much to everyone who participated and donated\u2014it was truly amazing seeing gamers come together to help others.

What does Calus have lined up for our most powerful Guardians?\n\n\n\n* Increased Power Difficulty: Starts at 750, increases to 770\n* Matchmaking is disabled; you must form a fireteam to enter\n* Weekly curated gameplay modifiers, rotating per boss\n* Unlike normal mode, Guardians can hit a failure state\n\n\n   * Extinguish is active; if your team wipes, Calus will send you to orbit\n   * Encounters never repeat; if you fail to reach 100% progress toward the boss after completing each encounter once, you will be returned to orbit\n* Heroic-mode-specific Triumphs, rewards, and challenges await you\n\n\nThough we\u2019ll be watching, this won\u2019t be a race. We\u2019re excited to see how players customize their experience with various challenges to show off their skill. Can you defeat Heroic mode with fewer than six players? Maybe with specific loadouts? Only time will tell.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Take Pride\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125225/Pride_Pin.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/V0qLCm5.jpg)\n\n\nJune isn\u2019t the only time when we live our values as a company, but it\u2019s a great opportunity to celebrate them. Here is an important message from the **Bungie Diversity Committee** on how you can join us in expressing your pride, along with the people who make the games you play.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Pride Month is an exciting time of year, when we can all unite under a rainbow flag and celebrate our LGBTQIA+ family. Bungie has come together this month to do more than we've been able to accomplish before.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We have a [Pride pin for sale on our Bungie Store](https://bungiestore.com/collections/collectibles/products/pride-collectible-pin), with all proceeds going directly to the [It Gets Better Project](https://itgetsbetter.org/) (a nonprofit organization with a mission to uplift, empower, and connect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth around the globe). This year, not only will Bungie continue its tradition of marching in the Seattle Pride Parade as an official sponsor, but we have also teamed up with other nearby dev studios to create a more united game industry alliance. While we celebrate this month, it\u2019s vital that we stay centered on what Pride is truly about; the equal rights and representation of the LGBTQIA+ community, People who deserve to be celebrated and recognized for their role in making our community as amazing as it is.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cFor me, Pride means being able to be visible to someone who needs representation (even when they may not realize it), as opposed to how it used to be where visibility only meant being a target.\u201d **\u2014Jayce D., Designer**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We on the Bungie Diversity Committee are committed to improving Bungie\u2019s work culture, practices, and policies in order to make this community a more welcoming and inclusive space for our LGBTQIA+ employees and fans around the world. This work does not start and end in June; rather, it\u2019s a series of challenges that we work on every day, month after month. Here at Bungie, we know there are still a lot of ways we could be doing better. We also know that our industry sometimes drags its heels when it comes to necessary change. However, we must keep moving forward for the sake of our own teams, coworkers, families, and players who need to know that they are seen, accepted, welcomed, and loved for exactly who they are.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cOne of the most empowering things I\u2019ve experienced is the acknowledgement that I exist in a world that generally pretends otherwise. This was the greatest gift games have ever given me, and one of the most important things I want to do as a developer is give that gift to players.\u201d **\u2014David S., Engineer**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We look forward to celebrating Pride Month with all of you. Let\u2019s keep our eyes up, and do our part to forge a brighter future.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014Bungie Diversity Committee\n\n\nPlease note: If the [Pride Collectible Pin](https://bungiestore.com/collections/collectibles/products/pride-collectible-pin) shows \u201cCurrently Unavailable\u201d on the Bungie Store, this indicates that the item is currently out of stock. We plan to have these available through Pride month, and beyond. If you\u2019re interested in snagging one of these pins, but it\u2019s not available, make sure to click the \u201cEmail when available\u201d option on the portal to be notified the moment they\u2019re back in stock!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Preserving the Truth\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/dQ9YLnS.gif)\n\n\nThe members of Destiny Player Support navigate the help forum daily, spreading helpful tips on how to work around issues or collecting data on any newly surfaced problems within *Destiny 2*.

The week started with a Chalice and led to a reveal. Earlier today, we hosted a stream to unveil the next chapter for *Destiny 2*. If you\u2019ve somehow found yourself reading this article without seeing the news, let\u2019s get you caught up.\n\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/WVk4PkTG99o)\n\n\n[Everything you need to know can be found here](http://firehose/en/Explore/Detail/News/47882). Shadowkeep is on the horizon, with Eris calling upon Guardians to return to the moon and challenge Nightmares from their past. New Light will introduce Guardians to the world of *Destiny*. Stadia and Steam will provide new ways for players to join our community, and Cross Save will unite them on the same journey together.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll be diving deeper into all of these projects throughout the summer. Our next stop will be E3, though we won\u2019t have the usual booth and fanfare this year. Instead, we\u2019ll be visiting with people to talk more about what we have planned. Keep your eyes peeled next week, and you might see us in the media that originates at the show.\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited for what\u2019s to come. Until then, we have an entire Season of content to play. A Season\u2026 of Opulence!\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Chalice to Calus\n\nSeason of Opulence kicked this week off with a six-hour race to get ready for a new raid. Teams from around the globe took on the challenge, methodically completing activities for powerful rewards to take on Gahlran and the Crown of Sorrow. With Contest mode active, enemies presented a challenge as players picked apart each encounter and its mechanics.\n\n\nEmployees from all disciplines flooded in to a small theater room to watch the action unfold throughout the race. As we approached four and a half hours, the crown was taken. Clan Be Bold is officially the bread winner of the Crown of Sorrow raid.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124699/Crow_of_Sorrow_Raid_Belt_Final.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7NsrvG1.jpg)\n\n\nWe\u2019re passing the mic to fireteam member [CarolinaGamer99](https://twitter.com/carolinagamer99) for a few words on their World\u2019s First win:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**CG:** World\u2019s First, a title that means more than most people can imagine to me. I\u2019ve played *Destiny* since launch and I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting and making friends for life. Some of these friends are my clanmates, the guys that I\u2019ve been through a lot with. We\u2019ve all been in top 10 raid race finishes before, but we finally did it with Crown of Sorrow. I\u2019d like to say thank you to my amazing teammates who put up with the sound of me munching on various snacks for the entirety of raid day, to the amazing teams at Bungie for creating an incredible experience for everyone who plays, and to the awesome community for cheering us on and believing in us.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;***WE GOT THE BELT WOOOOOOO!!!\u00a0***\n\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the people who developed Crown of Sorrow, here\u2019s a few words from **Design Lead Brian Frank**:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Brian:** Another world first viewing party is behind us.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Having the theater crammed full of devs eagerly watching together as fireteams make their journey into the unknown to take on the challenge of the Raid is always a blast.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The eruptions of cheering when an encounter is cleared or a boss is brought down are priceless and sincerely a highlight of the work for myself and the team.\n\n\nWith each raid, we are humbled by this community and your ability to overcome challenges. Whether you\u2019re a hardcore raider, a Crucible legend, or you\u2019re just here to enjoy the show, we can\u2019t thank you enough for playing.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Destination: GuardianCon\n\nThis July, we\u2019ll launch a team to [GuardianCon](https://www.guardiancon.co/). Our mission objective will be to celebrate this amazing community. We\u2019ve had a representative from Bungie in attendance every year this gathering has been a thing\u2014except for that first spontaneous flash mob in an unsuspecting pub. We\u2019ve watched this event evolve alongside the community that created it, and we wouldn\u2019t miss it for anything.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll be live on stage with the showrunners. We\u2019ll be on the convention floor with a Bungie Booth bristling with attractions. If we\u2019ll see you there, here\u2019s a preview of what you can expect.\n\n\n**GuardianCon Exclusive Loot**\n\n*Destiny 2* will be playable on 72 stations. We\u2019ll be hosting a series of private Crucible matches in Season of Opulence. If you have yet to fully grasp the new meta, you\u2019ll be invited to equip new weapons and suit up in a full set of Menagerie or raid gear as a Hunter, Titan, or Warlock.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124699/GC_Loot.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8X2EetK.jpg)\n\n\nTo raise the stakes, we\u2019ve conceived something special for GuardianCon that we\u2019re calling **Risk/Reward Matches**. Win or lose, anyone who plays a **Reward Match** will receive a Drifter coin that can be earned only at the show. Lines permitting, you\u2019ll be able to play as often as you like and collect as many coins as you can carry. Keep them or pay them forward. If you\u2019d like to take a chance at winning a more prestigious reward, you can spend your coin to commit to a **Risk Match** against another fireteam. If you win that match, you\u2019ll win a Guardian Pin that\u2019s also exclusive to the show. We\u2019re inviting you to leave with either a dog tag or a medal.\n\n\n**World First Award Ceremony**\n\nEver since Aetheon made the first grand entrance in the Vault of Glass, many fireteams have been entered into legend as the first Guardians to complete a *Destiny* raid. At GuardianCon, they\u2019ll take the stage with us to be celebrated as a champions.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124699/Big_Show.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UWkQjw0.jpg)\n\n\nHefting all of these belts will not be light work, so we found a fan of the game to help us with the heavy lifting.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Honored and really excited to share the stage with [@bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). I\u2019ve been invited to GaurdianCon July 5th to lead the ceremony for Raid World First winners. Gaurdians I look forward to meeting you all.

You could have a chance to shake the hand that has broken a controller or two.\n\n\n*Please Note (and don\u2019t panic) if you\u2019ve earned World\u2019s First Status, but can\u2019t be at the show, your names will be spoken and we\u2019ll send your belt to you by other means.*\n\n\n**An Audience With Eris Morn**\n\nEver since we plundered the dark below the Moon, the voice of Eris Morn has been a great friend of the *Destiny* community. She\u2019s contributed her talent to every major release of *Destiny* content, and we\u2019re about hear more from her this fall.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124699/Morla.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JGJHOCD.jpg)\n\n\nAt GuardianCon, she\u2019ll be an honorary member of the Bungie Away Team.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Destiny community has been and continues to be passionate, inspiring and welcoming.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That\u2019s why I\u2019m SO honored to announce I\u2019ll be appearing [@GuardianCon](https://twitter.com/GuardianCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) this year! \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Can. Not. Wait. to get beyond hyped with you about what\u2019s next for Destiny! \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;See you then, Guardians!\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014 Morla Gorrondona (@actor_morla) [June 6, 2019](https://twitter.com/actor_morla/status/1136748203829653504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\nMorla will be on hand to meet players, sign memorabilia, and silence the screams of any Hive outbreaks that may occur (even though that\u2019s her voice, too).\n\n\n**Gunsmith Inspection**\n\nThe *Destiny* community includes many amazing prop makers, but Eric Newgard has been our official outfitter for some time. His works adorn several corners of our studio. We\u2019ve commissioned him to create replicas of iconic weapons to commemorate special occasions. He has even moved among Guardians dressed in the robes of a Warlock. At GuardianCon, he\u2019ll have his own corner of our booth to fabricate a *Destiny* weapon you\u2019ve never seen.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019re very excited to announce that we\u2019ll be a part of the [@Bungie](https://twitter.com/Bungie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) booth at [@GuardianCon](https://twitter.com/GuardianCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)! An armory of iconic weapons from the Destiny universe will be on display and Eric, our chief weaponsmith, will be putting the finishing touches on a never before seen exotic... come and see!

We think of them as behind-the-scenes features delivered in a live-fire exercise. At GuardianCon, we\u2019ll do it live!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124699/Ride_Along.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/9GHVRV0.jpg)\n\n\nTwo of the creators of the Whisper of the Worm and Zero Hour missions will take to a stage to share some commentary while designated players move through experiences that have captured the imagination of the Guardians when they least expected it.\n\n\n**Players Meet Developers**\n\n\nWe\u2019ll have many people who work at Bungie on hand to meet the people who bring their work to life. They\u2019ll be overseeing the Risk/Reward Matches. You\u2019ll meet them at signing tables. They\u2019ll move among you throughout the celebration, hoping to have a chance to hear your stories.\n\n\n**Players Meet Each Other**\n\n\nThose same signing tables in our booth will also be home to leaders of this community who need space to meet the people who have enjoyed their content over the years. We\u2019re approaching our fifth anniversary as a community, so there are a lot of relationships to strengthen for the future. That\u2019s our goal for GuardianCon. This will be a celebration of the people who make *Destiny* so much more than a game.\n\n\nWe hope we\u2019ll see you there.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Goldsmiths\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uGM3wlM.gif)\n\n\nOpulence is upon us, but there are a few dents in the Chalice to hammer out. Destiny Player Support is on hand to walk us through the issues found since launch.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;***Destiny 2* Season of Opulence Known Issues**\n&gt;\n&gt;Following the launch of Season of Opulence, our local Player Support Team has begun tracking the following emergent issues:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* **Crown of Sorrow Joining in Progress:** Players who join in progress during the Crown of Sorrow raid\u2019s first encounter will spawn in dead outside of the encounter space. To mitigate this issue, all fireteam members must join up in Orbit prior to launching the Crown of Sorrows raid activity.\n* **Pools in the Crown of Sorrow Raid:** Players who step outside of a Witch's Blessing pool right as it is captured can block certain encounters from starting. It's recommended to stay inside the pool until it's 100% captured.\n* **Menagerie Gauntlet Respawns:** We are investigating an issue where players who die during the Gauntlet encounter in the Menagerie may be blocked from respawning until the encounter is completed.\n* **Allegiance Quest:** We are investigating an issue where players cannot progress past Spider's Black Market in the Allegiance quest.\n* **Ikora or Drifter Beacons:** We are investigating an issue where Ikora or Drifter may be beaconing players in the Tower Director map, depending on who players chose during the Allegiance quest.\n* **Machine Gun Reserves Perk:** We are investigating an issue where the Machine Gun Reserves perk is no longer available on some armor.\n* **Sturm \"Accomplice\" Perk:** We are investigating an issue where [Sturm](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/2907129556)'s \"Accomplice\" perk is not reloading Energy weapons other than [Drang ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/2362471600)and [Drang (Baroque)](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/79075821).\n* **PC Chat /Invite and /Join Commands:** We're investigating an issue where these commands no longer work if the player isn't on a player's friends list.\n* **PC Silver Purchases:** We're investigating an issue where PC players cannot purchase Silver through *Destiny 2*. PC players may still purchase Silver through the Battle.net app or website, and they must relaunch *Destiny 2* for the Silver to show up.\n* **Eververse Exotic Ghosts and Projections:** We are aware of an issue where Ghost projections can't be previewed on Season 7 Eververse Exotic Ghosts.\n* **Revelry Proud Reveler Perk:** We're aware that the Proud Reveler perk shows up on the character screen when players wear Revelry armor.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the latest known issues as soon as they are discovered, players should visit our [*Destiny 2*: Season of Opulence Known Issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/252323677) thread.

On the journey of our creative process, we arrived at a new experience that is more about discovery than mystery. Calus has issued an imperial summons. Your invitation to plunder the vaults aboard his Leviathan has arrived. Season of Opulence does have secrets for you to discover\u2014Destiny always does.\n\n\nHere is a preview of what adventures await.\u00a0\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZAnNh_y5Go)\n\n\nReady to play? These are the dates you should save!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124143/AE_Season7_Calendar_EN_16X9_EXPORT_FOR_LOC.jpg)\n\n\nThis is the last weekly update before the new Season starts. Let\u2019s dig in and cover the final details before the games begin.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Choose Wisely\n\nCalus would see you grow fat from strength. During Season of Opulence, he will be granting players the Chalice of Opulence, which serves as players\u2019 gateway to treasure. Players who emerge victorious in the Menagerie will use the Chalice to serve up an offering of runes in exchange for the weapons and gear they choose from the selection of items available. The treasure you find will be limited at first, but over time you\u2019ll be able to upgrade the Chalice to acquire more plentiful and powerful rewards.\n\n\nEach player will claim their Chalice at the start of the Season through an introductory quest line. From there, it can be shared between different Guardians on the same account.\n\n\n**How does it work?**\n\n\n\n* Earn runes to slot on your Chalice through the following:\n\n\n   * Completing weekly bounties\n   * Opening up the weekly chests on the new Nessus Barge\n   * Using a consumable that will reward you a rune after a strike, Crucible, or Gambit completion\n\n\n      * The same consumable will also give other players in your fireteam a chance to earn an additional rune\n* Slot the runes into your Chalice before you enter the Menagerie\n* Play the Menagerie to earn your rewards\n* Completing the Menagerie will award you the gear you chose with your rune selections\u00a0\n\n\n   * Each rune affects what you receive and some of its properties, depending on how you slot them\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/english.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PZottKv.png)\n\n\n**It\u2019s upgradable!**\n\nYou will have a host of new Triumphs and bounties to complete that will reward a new currency called Imperials. Using these Imperials, you can upgrade your Chalice to acquire a variety of perks with a wide range of effects, from giving you more powerful rewards per week to allowing you to choose the specific gun and Masterwork stat you get from the Menagerie!\n\n\nYou can earn Imperials several ways:\n\n\n\n* Completing weekly bounties\n* Completing certain Triumphs\n* Using special consumables that allows for Imperial acquisition\n* Chalice upgrades that allow you to earn Imperials through playlist activities\n\n\nYou choose which upgrades you unlock first!\u00a0\n\n\n\n* Unlock additional rune slots to allow more control of an item\u2019s specialization\n* Upgrade it so you earn more runes, or more rune variety\n* Upgrade to allow for additional powerful rewards from the Menagerie\n\n\nSo, for example, if you wanted to earn a random roll of a \u201cBeloved\u201d Sniper Rifle with Handling as the Masterwork trait, you would use a Rune of Jubilation, any red rune, and any purple rune. This rune configuration is your freebie. We\u2019re excited for the community to come together and uncover combinations for each Menagerie reward.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/Beloved.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uDZ1hLo.jpg)\n\n\nWe hope this gives you a better idea of how you\u2019ll earn weapons and armor during Season of Opulence. You will still have to grind to get that perfect roll, but we have given you the option to target the item that you want to optimize and Masterwork.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Pinnacle Weapons and More\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/123/123706/03292018_sandbox_header.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xREJdhw.jpg)\n\n\nLast week, we promised we would share the details on the new pinnacle weapons coming in Season of Opulence as well as some other weapons we are buffing. Here is the **Destiny Dev Team** to give you one last preview before show time.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: As with Season of the Drifter, we have another three pinnacle weapons to earn in Season of Opulence.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Vanguard\u2014Wendigo-GL3 (Arc Adaptive Grenade Launcher)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Wendigo-GL3\u2019s unique perk is \u201c**Explosive Light**\u2014Picking up an Orb of Light increases the next grenade\u2019s blast radius and damage\u201d\n&gt;* Unlike most drum Grenade Launchers, Wendigo-GL3 comes with Blinding Grenades as its magazine option for some added utility to shut down teleporting Taken Captains or that Cabal Gladiator about to get in your face\n&gt;* You can carry up to six grenades enhanced by Explosive Light, so be sure to not let any Orbs of Light slip through your fingers when you\u2019ve got this weapon equipped\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/pinnacle_Vanguard.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/nWZGZXE.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Crucible\u2014Revoker (Kinetic Aggressive Sniper Rifle)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Revoker\u2019s unique perk is \u201c**Reversal of Fortune**\u2014Missing a shot returns the bullet to the magazine after a short duration\u201d\n&gt;* Even the greatest of snipers is not a perfect sharpshooter, and you miss every shot you don\u2019t take\n&gt;* Revoker was built with the mindset that you should always go for it, but keep in mind that Reversal of Fortune can only return a single bullet at a time\n&gt;* Along with its unique perk, this sniper has a custom low zoom Ambush SLH25 scope and Snapshot for those close quarters battles\n&gt;* Acquiring Revoker will not require reaching Fabled rank in Competitive\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Players will need to earn 3500 total Glory points\n&gt;   * You do not lose progress when losing a match\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/pinnacle_Crucible.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SrnIJmo.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Gambit\u2014Hush (Solar Precision Combat Bow)**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Hush\u2019s unique perk is \u201c**Archer\u2019s Gambit**\u2014Hipfire precision hits grant a massive draw speed bonus for a short duration\u201d\n&gt;* This weapon is for those who would proclaim mastery with the Combat Bow\n&gt;* Archer\u2019s Gambit pays out significantly better than Archer\u2019s Tempo, but it\u2019s going to take a more skilled hand to get the most out of it\n&gt;* Make those shots count\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/pinnacle_Gambit.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AwrLLZz.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We also have a few weapons and archetypes getting some tuning to make them more effective. Contrary to a popular meme, we will be buffing Fusion Rifles this season.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Fusion Rifles**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Non-Exotic Fusion Rifles\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Damage increased against PvE combatants\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * High-Impact increased by 30%\n&gt;      * Precision increased by 44%\n&gt;      * Adaptive increased by 44%\n&gt;      * Rapid-Fire increased by 47%\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While some of the Exotic Fusion Rifles (Telesto, J\u00f6tunn, Merciless) did receive minor adjustments due to inheriting from their Legendary counterparts, they\u2019re minor increases, under 5% each. This change was done to move Legendary Fusion Rifles a little closer to the Exotics as the gap between them was quite large, at least in PvE.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sturm and Drang**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Storm and Stress max overcharge rounds increased to 99\n&gt;* \"Sturm Overcharge\" buff text now displays the number of overcharge rounds\n&gt;* Overcharge damage increased by 100% in PvE\n&gt;\n&gt;Sturm and Drang were weapons that lost a bit of their place in PvE once *Forsaken* hit. Not being able to carry around a special weapon hurts your output, so Sturm fell to the wayside. With these changes, along with a new version of Drang coming out in the Season of Opulence, we hope that it has some time to shine again.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/Drang.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iCW5pwo.jpg)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Swords**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Ammo capacity increased to a max of 70\n&gt;* Starting ammo increased by 10\n&gt;* Black Talon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Ground and aerial projectile ammo cost increased from 3 to 4\n&gt;* Adaptive Frame\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Ground uppercut ammo cost increased from 3 to 4\n&gt;* Aggressive Frame\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Now lunge at target with their aerial light attack\n&gt;   * Light attack consolidated into a single damage event\n&gt;   * Slam attack consolidated into a single damage event\n&gt;   * Slam attack ammo cost increased from 3 to 4\n&gt;* Lightweight Frame\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Damage tuning\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      * Ground light attack increased by 17%\n&gt;      * Aerial light attack decreased by 21%\n&gt;      * Ground dash attack increased by 87%\n&gt;      * Aerial dash attack increased by 78%\n&gt;      * No ammo aerial light attack decreased by 49%\n&gt;      * All other no ammo attacks decreased by 15%\n&gt;   * Ground dash attack ammo cost increased from 2 to 3\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Swords are getting some adjustments. We increased ammo capacity, but also increased the cost of heavy attacks proportionally to encourage mixing in light attacks to get the most out of them instead of just repeatedly using heavy attacks. Also, much like how Drang will show up in a new form for the Season of Opulence, the Lightweight and Aggressive swords are getting the same treatment.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/Swords.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sdyTIZh.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Raiders of the Lost Vault\n\nLast week, we put out an update on the upcoming World First raid race starting on June 4. You can also check out our [official World First rules](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/47218). At the end of race, **six players** will earn themselves a championship belt. Here is a work-in-progress preview of what it\u2019s going to look like.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/Crow_of_Sorrow_Rewards_belt.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ohPBLUX.jpg)\n\n\nAre you an avid raider, but don\u2019t think you can finish first? There are still some other enticing rewards available for those brave enough to tackle the raid soon after launch. If you are able to defeat the final encounter in the first 24 hours, you will receive the \u201cHeavy is the Crown\u201d emblem.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/Crow_of_Sorrow_24_Hour_Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/o5Q6Xei.jpg)\n\n\nDon\u2019t think you have it in you to finish in the first day? You still have time to commemorate your achievement if you can best the Crown of Sorrow raid before the weekly reset on 6/11. Do that, and you will unlock the ability to purchase this exclusive [Bungie Rewards](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47198) jacket.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/Crow_of_Sorrow_Rewards_Jacket.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1INHuxH.jpg)\n\n\nEven if you don\u2019t enjoy raiding, we will have some more cool stuff for you on the [Bungie store](https://bungiestore.com/collections/whats-new/products/tr3-vr-t-shirt) starting on 6/4\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/123/123967/Bungie_Store.jpg)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Patch Note Preview\n\n\nNext week, Season of Opulence will go live. Update 2.5.0 is the ship carrying it to your platform of choice. We wanted to take this final moment to give you one last preview of some of the changes you can expect to see in the full patch notes on June 4.\u00a0\n\n\n* Fixed and issue where the Heroic version of Zero Hour would only be available on the first character to complete the activity on each account\n\n* The Luxurious Toast emote now allows players to sit for as long as they desire\n\n* Players can no longer win Crucible matches by getting kills after the timer has expired\n\n* Fixed an issue where the action for applying shaders, ornaments, holograms, or using consumables was getting cancelled and not applying on the first attempt\n\n   * There are still actions that will cancel the apply function, such as hitting the \"Preview\" button, exiting Inventory early, letting up on the \"Apply\" button too early, or completely moving the cursor off of the item being applied\n\n* Players with multiple Radiant Matrix materials in their inventory will now have them removed when \"Returning to Ada-1\" on the appropriate weapon frame quest step\n\n* If players have Radiant Matrix materials sitting with the Postmaster, they will need to pull them out before speaking with Ada-1\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Hot Pursuit\n\nOne more notable upgrade you\u2019ll notice as Season of Opulence begins will be your Pursuits tab.\u00a0\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124300/english_1.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lNok7ia.png)\n\n\nThe Pursuits menu will be moved from your Inventory to the Director. With this update, you\u2019ll be able to switch between Pursuits and the Director overview in one move. With the objectives displayed in the new tab, it should be easier than ever for you to plan your gameplay session and knock out some bounties more efficiently. We also added some filters to give you a \u201cquests only\u201d and \u201cbounties only\u201d view, so you can separate limited-time pursuits from long-term pursuits. We also increased the pursuits size from 50 to 63 to give you more room to horde some bounties.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##At Your Service\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fKTmBTX.gif)\n\n\nThe Player Support Team will be on hand during next week\u2019s launch. If things get weird, let them know on the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help&amp;tSort=0&amp;tType=0&amp;d=0&amp;lang=en).\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;***Destiny 2* Update 2.5.0.1**\n&gt;\n&gt;Next Tuesday, June 4, the 2.5.0.1 update will be released to players in Destiny 2. This update marks the beginning of Season of Opulence, and is required in order to access Destiny 2 once it has been deployed. Listed below is the [release timeline](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/13125) for this update.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Tuesday, June 4:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **7 AM PDT (1400 UTC)**: Destiny 2 maintenance will begin.\n&gt;* **8 AM PDT (1500 UTC)**: Destiny 2 and Companion features will be taken offline. Destiny 2 Update 2.5.0.1 will begin rolling out across all platforms and regions.*\n&gt;* **10 AM PDT (1700 UTC)**: Maintenance will conclude. Destiny 2 and Companion features will be back online. Season of Opulence will begin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;*Players on console who are taking an abnormally long time to receive this update should try updating manually. Follow the links below for instructions on how to accomplish this:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* [Manually Updating Destiny on PS4](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/45174#Manual)\n&gt;* [Manually Updating Destiny on Xbox One](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/45173#Manual)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who still do not see this update may wish to try power cycling their console hardware. To do this, players should:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Completely power down the console. Ensure that the device is not in rest mode.\n&gt;* Unplug the console from its power source.\n&gt;* Wait 5 minutes.\n&gt;* Plug back in and try again.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If the update is available, it should begin downloading automatically after power cycling the console hardware. If not, players may wish to try manually checking for this update once more before resorting to another power cycle.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;During this same window, we will also be conducting backend maintenance for Destiny 1. For live updates during this deployment window, players should follow [@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/bungiehelp) on Twitter or monitor our support feed at [help.bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Crown of Sorrow Raid World First Race**\n&gt;\n&gt;[Last week at Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47833), we promised that we\u2019d share more information about how players can make sure they are at the starting line for the Crown of Sorrow raid at 4 PM PDT on Tuesday, June 4. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* As called out last week, players must complete the day one quest for Season of Opulence in order to access the Crown of Sorrow raid once it unlocks at 4 PM PDT.\n&gt;* In game, this quest will be granted to players as \u201cAn Imperial Summons,\u201d and will conclude as \u201cThe Invitation.\u201d\n&gt;* As players complete this quest, they will be awarded rare gear that will bring them up to 690 Power.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We\u2019d also like to remind all World First contenders that players who join in progress during the Crown of Sorrow raid\u2019s first encounter will spawn in dead outside of the encounter space. To mitigate this issue, all fireteam members must join up in Orbit prior to launching the Crown of Sorrow raid activity.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Living in Infamy**\n&gt;\n&gt;Players should be aware that turning in completed Gambit or Gambit Prime bounties from Season of the Drifter after Season of Opulence begins will result in the player\u2019s next Infamy rank up granting rewards capped at 700 Power.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To mitigate this, players are encouraged to turn in all completed bounties before Season of Opulence begins. For more information, players should see the \u201cCleaning House\u201d sections of the following blog posts:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* [This Week at Bungie\u20141/25/2019](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47589)\n&gt;* [This Week at Bungie\u20141/31/2019](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47602)\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Movies\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rbZM74O.gif)\n\n\nListen, we got the movies.

On June 4, we\u2019ll deliver the full and final patch notes.\u00a0 Before that happens, though, we\u2019d like to share with you some more of the key changes you\u2019ll be seeing in Season of Opulence.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##From One Season to the Next\n\n\nAs Season of the Drifter comes to a close, a new source for powerful rewards will emerge. The Drifter will return to his role as your Gambit hype man, and Benedict 99-40 is about to become your source for brand new secrets and rewards.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at how this new perspective will be making some sweeping changes to your weekly routine\u2026\n\n\n**Power Surge\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Instead of a set of bounties, a new Power Surge quest will be your jumping off point for Season of Opulence\n* You will need to complete this quest to access the new Raid!\n* Learning from Season of the Forge, this quest must be completed only once per account\n* After one character completes the quest, alternate characters will be rewarded with Surge gear at Power Level 690\n\n\n**Gambit Bounties**\n\n\n\n* We didn\u2019t want rewards from The Drifter to be one of the primary sources of power following his run as the central character for Season of the Drifter\n* As a result, Power boosts received from Gambit Bounties will decrease once you\u2019ve achieved 700 Power\n* They will decrease even further once you reached 720 Power\n\n\n**Prime Attunements**\n\n\n\n* On day one, prime attunements will be reset to two charges for each player\n* You\u2019ll receive two new prime attunements, even if you were playing right up to the reset\n* We want you to be able to play your favorite character without it impacting your power leveling strategy. We talked about this in a [previous TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47811)\n\n\n**Crown of Sorrow Raid**\n\n\n\n* The Crown of Sorrow raid begins on day one of Season of Opulence at 4 PM PDT\n* Players who want to compete will need to complete the Power Surge Quest\n* We\u2019ve taken additional steps to level the playing field for World First status\n* [All player power will be capped at power under each encounter within the raid for the first 24 hours](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47832)\n\n   * While Contest is active, players will face an enforced challenge throughout the Raid. This means, Power beyond certain levels will provide no advantage for a given fight (e.g., for the first fight all Power above 700 won't provide an advantage, and for the final fight Power above 720 will not provide an advantage).\u00a0\n   * We are going to deploy the update at 8AM Pacific and the game will be down until 10AM Pacific, so that as many players as possible can get through the download and verification step and be ready for Opulence launch.\u00a0\n* Our goals for this cap:\n\n\n\n   * Progression that challenges raiders to climb to compete for World First\n   * A World First race that tests your skill, communication, and strategy\n   * A World First raid that is fair\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Eververse Updates\n\n\nWith Season of Opulence, we\u2019re making some changes to the Eververse store.\u00a0\n\n\nWe had two main goals for the changes we\u2019re making to Eververse in Season of Opulence:\n\n\n**Direct Pick:\u00a0\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Every new Eververse item in Season of Opulence will be available for direct purchase via Silver or Bright Dust\n* Most of these offers will be time limited, with new items available weekly\n\n\n**Greatest Hits:\u00a0\u00a0**\n\n\n\n* Season of Opulence\u2019s Bright Engram will contain a collection of community favorite legacy items, with a focus on the \u201cBest of Year One.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n* If you missed out on Spicy Ramen or the Selfie Emote, Season of Opulence is your chance\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124099/Year_1.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bIDWdCj.jpg)\n\n\nSome additional details:\n\n\n**Armor:**\n\n\n\n* Full armor sets will be made available as a single, per class bundle, as opposed to being offered only via Bright Engrams\n* Individual Armor pieces can also be purchased for Bright Dust whenever they appear on the storefront\n* These Armor pieces feature fixed perk rolls that are not randomized across duplicates\n\n\n**A Simpler Interface**\n\n\n\n* Specific items are now featured on the front page and will be cycled with each weekly reset\n* Most offers will be time-limited to make way for rotating inventory, with some coming back into rotation at a later date\n* \u00a0Players can access this new interface by visiting Tess in her usual Tower location\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124099/English.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qjP0nbc.jpg)\n\n\n**Wrapped Items and Refunds**\n\n\n\n* Individual items purchased for Silver will now go to the relevant character inventory location in a \u201cwrapped\u201d state\n* Example: A sparrow purchased directly for Silver will arrive \u201cwrapped\u201d in the Sparrow inventory\n* To use an item, it must be \u201copened\u201d just like a bundle\n* Once opened, the item functions and can be accessed normally\n* If you wish to refund an item, you will have seven days from purchase to do so\n* Items that have been opened cannot be refunded\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/124/124099/MTX_Refund.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/KQeq2Qr.jpg)\n\n\nAll of these changes go live on day one of Season of Opulence. As always, we\u2019ll be monitoring how this all works, and are eager to hear what you do and don\u2019t like about the new storefront.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##At Your Service\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/j5UUlFD.gif)\n\n\nBatman had Alfred. Iron Man had Jarvis. You have our Player Support Team.\n\n\nThis is their report.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Crown of Sorrow Raid: Day One Preparations**\n&gt;\n&gt;As soon as Season of Opulence kicks off on June 4, the World first race for the Crown of Sorrow raid will begin. To help illustrate a more definitive starting line, we\u2019ve provided vital information below that Day One contenders should be aware of.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Players will not be able to access the Crown of Sorrow raid if they have not yet completed the Season of Opulence Power Surge quest, even after this raid unlocks at 4 PM PDT. This will apply to all members in a Fireteam. *We\u2019ll have more information on this experience as we get closer to June 4*.\n* Players who join in progress during the Crown of Sorrow raid\u2019s first encounter will spawn in dead outside of the encounter space. To mitigate this issue, all Fireteam members must join up in Orbit prior to launching the Crown of Sorrow raid activity.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Look forward to reading more information as we get closer to the Season of Opulence launch.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Seasonal Weapon Drops**\n&gt;\n&gt;After Season of the Drifter concludes on June 4, the following weapons will be unavailable to unlock at their respective vendors for a limited time. An issue was discovered late in development, and we are working on a fix for a future patch.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* [Service Revolver](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/834081972) from Commander Zavala\n* [Last Perdition ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/188882152)from Lord Shaxx\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who have already unlocked these Year 2 variants will continue to receive them as random drops from rank up packages. Players who do not unlock these weapons by the June 4 deadline will be able to acquire the weapons once they are addressed in a future update.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It\u2019s worth noting that pursuit rewards such as [The Recluse](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/3354242550), [Oxygen SR3](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/3907337522), and [21% Delirium](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/1600633250) will continue to be available.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Movie of the Week\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/F3alzr6.gif)\n\n\nWe\u2019re always watching.

We\u2019ve also seen a preview of the new Raid jacket that is totally awesome. With the finer points for the systemic changes on the table, we can next turn our attention to revealing the places you\u2019ll go and the reasons you\u2019ll fight.\n\n\nRight now, our focus is on Opulence. But after the Season has launched and Raid belts have been awarded, we\u2019ll be looking deeper into the future, and sharing with you more about a new era for Bungie and Destiny 2.\n\n\nBuckle up and stay tuned.\u00a0\n\n\nDeeJ, out.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "subreddit_subscribers": 931876, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This Week At Bungie 05/23/2019", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559609993, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bs9s8g/this_week_at_bungie_05232019/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "DTG_Bot", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": "SS7 2-1 DinklebotGif", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\"Little Light\""}], "author_flair_text": "\"Little Light\"", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_mocx5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1558046051, "domain": "self.DestinyTheGame", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bpj5x6/this_week_at_bungie_5162019/", "gilded": 1, "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "id": "bpj5x6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5017, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bpj5x6/this_week_at_bungie_5162019/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "nZZdT-nEQkVErpMIAEa5X5MbZLTdSmXvUZqD0_3FbD8", "resolutions": [{"height": 27, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/0BtqoBnjEPDpt1K6XeSKZLk6kvtZcY1PUBEASjcrc2c.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=482535985b8f86f07722b20a7fe4bea8c379bc8d", "width": 108}, {"height": 55, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/0BtqoBnjEPDpt1K6XeSKZLk6kvtZcY1PUBEASjcrc2c.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1a99791075e121d326617c7da5fdff604f39665", "width": 216}, {"height": 82, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/0BtqoBnjEPDpt1K6XeSKZLk6kvtZcY1PUBEASjcrc2c.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59b13f811c5d91dba93e6ea81e1e0990181abf53", "width": 320}, {"height": 164, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/0BtqoBnjEPDpt1K6XeSKZLk6kvtZcY1PUBEASjcrc2c.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99ef30edf52be4db16503fefee8676eff2040f57", "width": 640}, {"height": 246, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/0BtqoBnjEPDpt1K6XeSKZLk6kvtZcY1PUBEASjcrc2c.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb80318179bbd7a3dc654f0c69de34716bc02fc5", "width": 960}, {"height": 276, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/0BtqoBnjEPDpt1K6XeSKZLk6kvtZcY1PUBEASjcrc2c.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a33d46dab8f0866d2a15818ec21b50df675562ff", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 298, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/0BtqoBnjEPDpt1K6XeSKZLk6kvtZcY1PUBEASjcrc2c.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=eab5e0dacafc76d103250cd7f564dafba27b9278", "width": 1162}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1558046053, "score": 0, "selftext": "Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47823\n\n---\n\nThis week at Bungie, we are hosting Lord Saladin one last time in the Season of the Drifter.\n\n\nThe final Iron Banner for this Season rages on.

Last week, we set your sights on a new raid that begins on June 4\u2014the same day that the new Season launches. We wanted to let you know what to expect from the new sandbox so you can plan accordingly. The **Destiny Dev Team** has the details.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Destiny Dev Team**: For Season of Opulence, several notable weapons are being adjusted.\u00a0 We want to ensure that encounters\u2014raids and other endgame content, for example\u2014remain a challenge. Some of these weapons have been overwhelming that challenge. Our first choice is to buff underused weapons, but if we continue to push every weapon up higher and higher, it will be impossible to maintain challenging experiences. This is not a full list of changes, but some of the most impactful.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Whisper of the Worm**\n&gt;\n&gt;Whisper of the Worm was already adjusted in Season of the Drifter, but an Exotic that can generate an infinite amount of Heavy ammo is still a gigantic outlier and renders many weapons irrelevant for certain encounters. While Exotics are intended to be powerful and novel, bypassing the ammo economy can tend to force us to adjust enemies to compensate. This effectively results in Sniper Rifles as a whole being punished because of Whisper\u2019s unique ammo ability. As a result, we\u2019re removing the ammo generation ability so that we can increase the effectiveness of all other Snipers that don\u2019t have an endless ammo supply.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* White Nail pulls ammo from reserves rather than creating it\n&gt;* Reserve ammunition increased to 18 (without ammo reserve perks)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Sleeper Simulant**\n&gt;\n&gt;The reduction of bounced shot damage for Sleeper Simulant is already present on several important enemies. We are now making this reduction part of the weapon. The difference in damage is too large between a single precision shot of Sleeper Simulant and an angled shot that pierces the target and then also hits the target again with the bounced projectiles. Much like Whisper, we\u2019ve had to adjust enemies around that potential. By making these changes a permanent part of the weapon, we can get it into a more balanced position.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Reduced ricochet/bounce damage on boss combatants\n&gt;* Modified precision behavior\u2014total damage is unchanged, but non-precision shots are significantly more forgiving\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Lord of Wolves**\n&gt;\n&gt;Lord of Wolves received a massive increase in damage with the full benefits of the Shotgun changes in Season of the Drifter. This made it a lot more popular, but we got a significant amount of feedback that Release the Wolves activating on every kill made it difficult to control the weapon\u2019s ammo consumption. As a result, we\u2019re allowing you to swap between the two states to control the output, while also reducing its output slightly.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* PvE damage reduced by 20%\n&gt;* Release the Wolves perk has been reworked:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * No longer triggers automatically on kill\n&gt;   * This effect is now triggered by holding reload, similar to \u201cThe Fundamentals\u201d on Hard Light and Borealis\n&gt;   * PvE damage and range bonuses on this effect has been removed and replaced with a universal damage bonus instead\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Ace of Spades**\n&gt;\n&gt;Ace of Spades is pretty hot in the Crucible, and has been since its inclusion in Destiny 2: Forsaken. The number of perks on the weapon, combined with the semi-permanent effect of Memento Mori gives the weapon too many advantages compared to other weapons. Now that Memento Mori ends when you stow the weapon, you\u2019ll need to make a decision on whether or not you\u2019ll keep the weapon drawn to retain the bonus.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Memento Mori now ends if the weapon is stowed\n&gt;* The PvP damage bonus of Memento Mori was slightly reduced to prevent two-tapping Guardians while Vengeance (One-Eyed Mask) was active\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Specifically, you need four resilience to survive this\n&gt;* Memento Mori is active for six shots again (up from five)\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Exotic Armor**\n&gt;\n&gt;Along with the weapons above, we will also be making some changes to some Exotic armor pieces. Primarily, we\u2019re paying attention to pieces of Exotic armor that grant back Super energy. We felt they are increasingly becoming \u201cmust-pick\u201d gear choices. Orb generation from teammates is meant to be the best way to accelerate your Super generation. These Exotics are allowing players to bypass this teamwork mechanic by generating a large amount of Super energy without relying on other players\u2019 orbs.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, because these items are so overwhelmingly strong in situations where players face off against large numbers of enemies, some activities were designed considering the use of armor such as Orpheus Rigs, Phoenix Protocol, Skull of Dire Ahamkara, etc. This means if someone in your fireteam doesn't have these Super Exotics equipped, the activity becomes far more difficult.\u00a0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We are making some changes to these armor pieces to try to preserve their power fantasy and still leave them as viable choices for difficult activities without making players feel like they must have them equipped or be at a huge disadvantage.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Super-Generating Exotic Armor Changes**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* Skull of Dire Ahamkara, Orpheus Rigs, and Phoenix Protocol now receive Super energy back with diminishing returns, making it rarer to get a full Super back\n&gt;* Shards of Galanor and Ursa Furiosa had their Super gain caps reduced to be in parity with other Super Exotic changes\n&gt;* Gwisin Vest had its energy reduced from 15% to 8% for killing one to two Guardians\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   * Still scales up similar to before when killing three or more Guardians\n&gt;   * PvE energy return remains similar to before\n\n\nWe\u2019re sympathetic about the fact that the changes we make in the interest of balancing combat and game design can be jarring. It was important that we have this conversation before you read the patch notes. We know many of you have a lot riding on day one of Season of Opulence. Hopefully, this intel will assist you in building the perfect monster-killing machines for the next Season of play.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Repping TR3-VR\u00a0\n\n\nIf you have ventured too deep into the old Tower, you may have awoken something in the darkness.

Pardon our dust.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Iron Planner\n&gt;\n&gt;Right now, Lord Saladin is in the Tower hosting the **final** Iron Banner for Season of the Drifter.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who have been pursuing the \u201cHeavy as Death\u201d emblem for defeating 2,500 Guardians in Iron Banner while affected by the Iron Burden have until the [weekly reset](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46165) on Tuesday, May 21. At that time, Lord Saladin will depart from the Tower, and Iron Banner will no longer be available for the remainder of the Season.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Only a few days remain to claim this reward, so players are encouraged to plan their matches now.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###Clarification of the Nine\n&gt;\n&gt;Tomorrow, X\u00fbr\u2019s final Invitation of the Nine becomes available to eligible players in Destiny 2.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Unlike similar experiences that players encountered in the Dreaming City when completing weekly bounties from Petra Venj, players cannot miss out on any of X\u00fbr\u2019s invitations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players who have fallen behind may resume progress by speaking to X\u00fbr the weekend after they complete their current invitation. From then on, progress will continue at a weekly cadence for players until they have completed all invitations.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;###*Destiny 2* Known Issues\n&gt;\n&gt;In addition to the known issues described above, we\u2019d like to touch on the following issue being investigated in Destiny 2.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;* **Riskrunner and PC BIRD Errors**: We are investigating an issue where [Riskrunner](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/DestinyInventoryItemDefinition/3089417789) may sometimes cause BIRD errors for PC players in the Zero Hour mission.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For other known issues tracked by the DPS team, please see our [Known Issues and Vital Information page](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46168).\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Popped Corn\u00a0\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_movie_of_the_week.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PDRhQV3.gif)\n\n\nWelcome back to Movie of the Week.

We\u2019ll be sharing more on what to expect over the next few weeks\n\n\nIt\u2019s been awesome watching players in the community take the time to help others fight their way through the Zero Hour mission. I think I might help some players out on LFG tonight. Or maybe I\u2019ll just slow them down, we\u2019ll see.

Some of our favorite moments in the studio happen when players uncover the secrets in\u00a0*Destiny*, whether it\u2019s a new dungeon in the Dreaming City or something much more sinister, hiding within eyeshot of the Traveler. With the release of Zero Hour, we got to enjoy that all over again, right alongside many of you. The team who brought this experience to life has a short message for you:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev Team:** Experiences like these are a salute to our inquisitive, skilled, and close-knit *Destiny* player community. We couldn\u2019t make these without the right audience to discover and enjoy them. Thanks for being awesome, and don\u2019t forget TR3-VR is waiting for you down there.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkJlZi600To)\n\n\nIt\u2019s time for your weekly dose of Bungie Blog content. We\u2019ve got some information on the upcoming season and your final chance to take on the Iron Burden. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Season of Opulence: Getting Raid Ready\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/123/123873/SoO_Banner.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ulJxx99.jpg)\n\n\nStarting June 4, 2019, Season of Opulence kicks off for all players of *Destiny 2*. Many of you are familiar with how raids can launch with new content\u2014usually on a Friday at reset. This season, we\u2019re doing something a little different. Owners of the Annual Pass will be challenged to conquer a new raid on day one. Here's some context on this new plan and changes to the upcoming Power climb:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;**Dev Team:** The world\u2019s first race for a raid is a competitive event. The raid is a challenge geared toward testing a fireteam\u2019s ability to learn and execute on the mechanics, as well as their ability to overcome enemies and bosses together. Having a short window of time between release and launch allows us to preserve the combat challenge for players making their attempt on day one and get people playing the raid content right away.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Crown of Sorrow**\n&gt;\n&gt;**June 4, 2019: 4 PM PDT**\n&gt;\n&gt;**Recommended Power for first encounter: 715**\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With this race, there will be a few minor changes to current investment systems to ensure an even playing field while players are increasing their Power at the launch of the Season.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* Last Wish and Scourge of the Past will be unavailable until Crown of Sorrow has been beaten\n\n\n   * This prevents players with a stash of Ethereal Keys from having a leg up in the race\n* Prime Attunements will be reset to two charges per character on day one\n\n\n   * While characters build Prime Attunement charges over time, these are being set to two per character upon logging in after the new season begins.\n   * All level 50 characters can earn Prime Engrams after signing in and playing during the Season of Opulence\n   * Players may continue to build Prime Attunements over time after the reset occurs\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As a reminder, any powerful bounties acquired prior to Season of Opulence will have a Power cap of 700. For additional information, see the \u201cCleaning House\u201d section of [this article](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47589).\n\n\nIf you\u2019re the type to take a day off work to celebrate the start of a new Season, get that request in now! We\u2019re officially four weeks away from Season of Opulence. We\u2019ll have more information on what\u2019s changing in the *Destiny 2* experience in June, so keep your eyes set on the blog for updates.\u00a0\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Stoke the Fire\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/123/123440/D2_Iron_Banner.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/szo7CUt.gif)\n\n\nThe final Iron Banner of Season of the Drifter takes place next week. Lord Saladin returns to the Tower, which is now clean of Revelry decorations, and invites you to participate in Power-enabled combat.\n\n\n**Iron Banner and Increased Valor**\n\n**Start: 10 AM PDT on May 14**\n\n**End: 10 AM PDT on May 21**\n\n\n*Destiny 2* Update 2.2.2, released earlier this week, fixed an issue where the Iron Ruby shader was not being rewarded when dismantling Iron Banner rewards. If you\u2019ve been looking to acquire this shader, you can either dismantle a reward that\u2019s already in your inventory or dismantle an Iron Banner reward next week. Lord Saladin will also feature the following weapons for direct purchase when completing their associated weekly bounties:\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/123/123873/Iron_Banner_Weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mM1Co5i.jpg)\n\n\n**NOTE:** This will be your final chance to participate in the Iron Burden experiment of Season 6. If you\u2019re currently on the path to earn 2,500 burdened kills and the \u201cHeavy as Death\u201d emblem, you have seven days to complete the \u201cNow You\u2019re Just Showing Off\u201d Triumph.\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/123/123440/Iron_Banner_Emblem.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tgoKXBd.jpg)\n\n\nAdditionally, this will be your final opportunity to unlock Season 6 Triumphs or armor sets related to Iron Banner. Get out there and make Saladin proud.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Player Support, Reporting In!\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/122/122662/D2_DPS_Gif_.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6yQgNmQ.gif)\n\n\nThis week brought a list of issue resolutions to *Destiny 2*, and a few issues have been discovered since the deployment of *Destiny* Update 2.2.2.

While we will not divulge the details of this mission for the uninitiated, a known issue has emerged that we would like to touch on.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Currently, we are investigating an issue where players are not receiving their reward drop when completing the Zero Hour mission on secondary characters, blocking access to the Heroic version of this mission.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Players should rest assured that they will receive this reward drop as expected for their first character who completes this mission, and this character may then move forward to the Heroic version. In the meantime, we will continue to investigate this issue.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;***Destiny 2* Maintenance: 5/9/2019**\n&gt;\n&gt;Today, *Destiny 2* underwent maintenance to resolve an issue where players may lose their Key Cards during the Heroic Zero Hour mission when using *Destiny* Companion features.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While we expect this to be resolved, players who still encounter this issue should report it to the [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;***Destiny 2* Known Issues**\n&gt;\n&gt;In addition to the known issues described above, we\u2019d like to touch on the following issues being investigated in *Destiny 2*.\n\n\n* **Bergusia Forge Crashes on PC:** We are investigating an issue where PC players may experience crashes in the Bergusia Forge with the Zero Hour reward equipped.\n* **\u201cLost Connection\u201d on PC:** PC players receiving a \u201clost connection\u201d server error may need to exit *Destiny 2* and check for updates in their BattleNet launcher.

With a mix of Reveler's Tonic, armor swapping, Arc Strider tomfoolery, and a cheeky teleport, a lone Guardian found success when challenging an ahamkara to battle.\n\n\n**Movie of the Week: Solo Riven**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/Bc9XaV61mN8)\n\n\n**Honorable Mention: Gambit Shark**\n\n[Video Link](https://youtu.be/ZF--yWXcg1A)\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like a chance at the Lens of Fate emblem, be sure to submit your footage to the Community Creations portal on bungie.net.\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nEvery time new content enters the game, an email is sent studio-wide reminding the team that the mysteries of *Destiny* are hand-crafted for you, the player, to uncover. We watch. We wait. We count the minutes until the first player notices something unique in a corner that has never been seen before. We monitor the conversation as players make progress toward their unknown prize. Then, we celebrate.\n\n\n**[Outbreak Perfected Wallpaper \u2013 [Click for 4k](http://downloads.bungie.net/images/Wallpapers/Outbreak_Prime_Perfected_4K.jpg)]**\n\n\n\n[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/123/123873/Outbreak_Prime_Perfected_Preview.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/npklsvY.jpg)\n\n\nNow, it\u2019s our turn to play.
